10,Acne,Overview,"Acne breakouts can happen anywhere on your skin. The most common sites include the face and neck, shoulders, back, and chest. Your skin has tiny holes called pores that can become blocked by oil, bacteria, dead skin cells, and dirt. When this occurs, you may develop a pimple, sometimes also called a zit or blemish. If you get pimples often, especially several at once repeatedly, you may haveacne. In other words, acne is the skin conditionthat causes pimples. Acne is very common. In fact, research estimates that9.4 percentof people worldwide have acne. In the United States, acne is the most common skin condition, according to theAmerican Academy of Dermatology (AAD). While acne doesn’t pose a serious risk to your overall health, it can still be painful, particularly if you have severe acne. Over time, acne might also cause scarring. There’s no denying that acne can contribute to emotional distress. Acne and acne scars on your face and other visible body locations can affect self-esteem and self-confidence, and they can even contribute tofeelings of anxiety or depression.

A number of effective treatments exist, so you have options for reducing the number of pimples you get and minimizing your chances of scarring."
11,Acne,What are the different types of acne?,"If you have acne, you might notice amix of pimple types. Whiteheadsandblackheads, both also referred to as comedones, are the most common acne lesions. Blackheads, or open comedones, open at the surface of your skin. Oxygen in the air (not dirt) gives the top of these pimples their darker appearance. Whiteheads, or closed comedones, form as raised bumps under the surface of your skin. They remain flesh-colored. Inflammatorylesions, which are more likely to cause scarring of your skin, include: Papules.These small, red, raised bumps are caused by inflamed or infected hair follicles. Pustules.These small red pimples have pus at their tips. Nodules.These solid, often painful lumps develop beneath the surface of your skin. Cysts.These large lumps beneath your skin contain pus and are usually painful."

Popping pimples can raise your chances of scarring, so avoid squeezing — no matter how tempting it feels to get rid of the pimple immediately — andtry these tips. Once a pimple develops, it can take anywhere froma few days to several weeksto completely clear up.An acne breakout can take a lot longer to heal and clear, especially without treatment."
13,Acne,What causes acne?,"Acne occurs when the pores of your skin become blocked with oil, dead skin, or bacteria. Each pore of your skin opens to a follicle. The follicle is made up of a hair and a sebaceous (oil) gland. The oil gland releasessebum(oil), which travels up the hair, out of the pore, and onto your skin. Sebum helps keeps your skin lubricated and soft. One or more mishaps in this lubrication process can contribute to acne. Acne might occur, for example, when: your follicles produce too much oil dead skin cells accumulate in your pores bacteria build up in your pores Any of these concerns can lead to pimples, which develop when bacteria grow in a clogged pore and the oil can’t escape."
14,Acne,What are the risk factors for developing acne?,"Experts still don’t know exactly why some people experience acne and others don’t. That said, they do recognize a number of risk factors can contribute to or worsen acne, including: hormonal changes due to pregnancy or puberty polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)and other endocrine conditions cigarette smoking poor sleep stress cleansers, creams, moisturizers, and other beauty productswith high oil content certain medications, includinglithium, some types of hormonal birth control, anticonvulsants, andsteroids a family history of acne You have the highest risk of developing acne during puberty. During this time, your body undergoes many hormonal changes. These changes can trigger oil production, leading to an increased risk of acne. Hormonal acne related to puberty usually improves when you reach adulthood, and your breakouts may even stop completely. According to a2021 review, certain foods or diets may have an effect on acne: Low glycemic index diet.Cutting back on foods with a high glycemic index, such as refined carbs and added sugars, couldhelp reduceacne lesions. Milk products.Consuming certain milk products, like milk and ice cream, seems to worsen acne for some people. However, cheese, as well as nonmilk dairy products, don’t seem to worsen acne. Fat and fatty acids.Omega-3andomega-6 fatty acidsmay help reduce acne breakouts. Vegan and vegetarian diets.While vegan and vegetarian diets can offer plenty of health benefits, little evidence supports them specifically for the treatment of acne. Probiotics.Whileprobiotics— found in yogurt, other fermented foods, and supplements — could help improve acne, experts have yet to find conclusive support for probiotics as an acne treatment."

They can help identify the types of lesions and their severity to develop a treatment plan that works for you."
16,Acne,Treatment for acne,"Treatment for acne generally depends on its severity. You can use over-the-counter (OTC) medicated creams, cleansers, and spot treatments to help address pimples as they pop up. Common ingredients you’ll find in acne creams and gels include: Benzoyl peroxide.This ingredienthelps dry out existing pimples, prevents new ones from forming, and kills acne-causing bacteria. Salicylic acid.This ingredienthelps exfoliate your skin to prevent pores from getting clogged with acne-causing bacteria. If you continue to experience symptoms after using OTC acne treatments for several weeks, you may want to consider reaching out for professional treatment. A dermatologist or other healthcare professional can prescribe medications that may help reduce your symptoms and prevent scarring. If you have moderate acne, a dermatologist may recommend: prescription-strength benzoyl peroxide antibiotics, like erythromycin orclindamycin retinoids, such asretinol In some cases, they may suggest an oral antibiotic orhormonal birth controlto help manage acne. Typically, you’ll only use antibiotics for a short time, so your body doesn’t build up a resistance and leave you prone to infections. For severe acne, a dermatologist may recommend treatment that combines one or more of the following: oral antibiotics benzoyl peroxide topical antibiotics topical retinoids They may also suggest hormonal birth control or oral isotretinoin, also known by the brand nameAccutane. Accutane is a vitamin-A medication used to treat certain cases of severenodular acne. It can cause serious side effects, and doctors usually only prescribe it when other treatments don’t work. Many acne treatments, including Accutane, can have severe consequences for a developing fetus.If you plan to become pregnant or believe you could be pregnant, ask the doctor or clinician who prescribed your medication if you can continue taking it.Your care team can also offer more guidance on other options totreat acne during pregnancy. Your dermatologist may also recommend medical procedures to treat severe forms of acne and prevent scarring. These procedures work by removing damaged skin and reducing oil production.

20,ADHD,Overview,"ADHD symptoms may manifest differently based on gender. However, social expectations may affect the way these symptoms are viewed and whether you ultimately receive ADHD diagnosis. Although ADHD is not classified as a learning disability, its symptoms may create challenges in learning environments. Healthcare professionals use a combination of approaches, including structured routines, organizational tools, and lifestyle adjustments, alongside treatments like therapy and medication. People with ADHD may have difficulty focusing their attention on a single task or sitting still for long periods of time. Many people experience inattention and changes in energy levels. But for a person with ADHD, this happens more often than in people who do not have the condition. This can have a significant effect on school, work, relationships, and home life. Both adults and children can have ADHD. It’s a diagnosis the American Psychiatric Association (APA) recognizes."
21,ADHD,ADHD symptoms,"A wide range of behaviors is associated with ADHD. Some of the more common ones include: having difficulty focusing or concentrating on tasks beingforgetfulabout completing tasks being easily distracted having difficulty sitting still interrupting peoplewhile they’re talking Signs and symptoms can be specific to different aspects of ADHD, such as hyperactivity, impulsivity, or difficulty focusing. A person who is experiencing hyperactivity and impulsivity may: find it difficult to sit still or remain seated in class have difficulty playing or carrying out tasks quietly talk excessively find it hard to wait for their turn interrupt others when they’re speaking, playing, or carrying out a task Someone who is having difficulty focusing might: make frequent mistakes or miss details when studying orworking find it hard to maintain focus when listening, reading, or holding a conversation have problems organizing their daily tasks lose items frequently be easily distracted by small things happening around them If you or your child has ADHD, you may have some or all of these symptoms. The symptoms you have will depend on the type of ADHD you have. Executive dysfunctionis a common symptom of ADHD and refers to difficulties in cognitive functions, such as paying attention, absorbing or remembering new information, ignoring distractions, and regulating emotions and behaviors."
22,ADHD,Types of ADHD,"To make ADHD diagnoses more consistent, the APA has grouped the condition into three categories, or types.These typesare predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactivity-impulsive, and a combination of both. The type of ADHD you or your child has will determine the treatment method. The ADHD type you have can change over time, so your treatment may change, too. As the name suggests, people with thistype of ADHDhave extreme difficulty focusing, finishing tasks, and following instructions. Experts also think that many children with the inattentive type of ADHD may not receive a proper diagnosis because they don’t tend to disrupt the classroom.Some researchsuggests this is more common among girls with ADHD. The use ofbinaryterms such as “male” and “female” or “men” and “women” in this article reflects the language of the sources we’ve used. Unless otherwise noted, it’s unclear whether the research we reference included participants withexpansive gender identities. People with thistype of ADHDprimarily show hyperactive and impulsive behavior. This can include: fidgeting interrupting people while they’re talking not being able to wait their turn Although inattention is less of a concern with this type of ADHD, people with predominantly hyperactive-impulsive ADHD may still find it difficult to focus on tasks. This is the most commontype of ADHD. People with this combined type of ADHD display both inattentive and hyperactive symptoms. These include an inability to pay attention, a tendency toward impulsiveness, and above-average levels of activity and energy."
23,ADHD,What causes ADHD?,"Despite how common ADHD is, doctors and researchers still are not sure whatcauses the condition. Doctors believe that ADHD has neurological origins. Genetics may also play a role. Recent researchsuggests that a reduction indopamine is a factor. Dopamine is a chemical in the brain that helps move signals from one nerve to another. It also triggers emotional responses and movements. Another2024 studysuggests a structural difference in the brain. Findings indicate that people with ADHD have less gray matter volume. Gray matter includes the brain areas that help with: speech self-control decision making muscle control Researchers are still studying potential causes of ADHD, such as smoking during pregnancy."
24,ADHD,ADHD diagnosis and testing,"If you suspect that you or your child has ADHD, talk with a healthcare professional about getting an evaluation. For your child, you can also talk with their school counselor. Schools regularlyassess childrenfor conditions that may be affecting their educational performance. Provide your doctor or counselor with notes and observations about your or your child’s behavior. If they suspect ADHD, they may refer you or your child to anADHD specialist. Tomake a diagnosis, a doctor will assess any symptoms you or your child has had over the previous 6 months using a variety of checklists and rating scales. Depending on the diagnosis, they may also suggest making an appointment with a psychiatrist or neurologist."
25,ADHD,ADHD treatment,"Treatment for ADHD typically includes therapy, medication, or both. Behavioral therapycan help you or your child learn how to monitor and manage your behavior. Withtalk therapy, you or your child will discuss how ADHD affects your life and ways to help you manage it. Medicationcan also be very helpful when you’re living with ADHD. ADHD medications are designed to affect brain chemicals in a way that enables you to better manage your impulses and actions. The two main types of medications used to treat ADHD are stimulants and nonstimulants. Healthcare professionals commonly prescribe ADHD medications, which are central nervous system (CNS) stimulants. These drugs work by increasing the amount of the brain chemicalsdopamineand norepinephrine. Examples of these drugs includemethylphenidate(Ritalin) and amphetamine-based stimulants (Adderall). If stimulants do not work well or cause troublesome side effects for you or your child, your doctor may suggest a nonstimulant medication. Certain nonstimulant medications work by increasing brain levels of norepinephrine. These medications include atomoxetine (Strattera) and some antidepressants likebupropion(Wellbutrin). ADHD medications can have many benefits, as well as side effects. In addition to — or instead of — medication, severallifestyle changeshave been suggested to help ease ADHD symptoms. This includes: eating abalanced diet getting at least 60 minutes ofphysical activityper day gettingplenty of sleep limitingdaily screen timefrom phones, computers, and TV Yoga,tai chi, andtime outdoorscan help calm overactive minds and may help ease ADHD symptoms. Mindfulness meditationis another option.Recent researchsuggests meditation might improve attention span in people with ADHD. Avoiding certainallergens and additivesis also a potential way to help reduce ADHD symptoms."
26,ADHD,ADD vs. ADHD,"You may have heard the terms “ADD” and “ADHD” and wonderedwhat the difference isbetween them. ADD, or attention deficit disorder, is an outdated term. It was previously used to describe people who have difficulty paying attention but are not hyperactive. The type of ADHD called “predominantly inattentive” is now used in place of ADD. ADHD is the current overarching name of the condition."
27,ADHD,ADHD in children,"Around8.8% of people ages 3 to 17 yearsin the United States have had a diagnosis of ADHD at some point. This includes 11.7% of boys and 5.7% of girls. For children, ADHD is generally associated with problems at school.Children with ADHDoften have difficulties in a controlled classroom setting. Boys are more than twice as likely as girls to receive an ADHD diagnosis. This may be because boys tend to exhibit hallmark symptoms of hyperactivity. Although somegirls with ADHDmay have the classic symptoms of hyperactivity, many do not. In many cases, girls with ADHD may be hyper-talkative and daydream frequently. Many ADHD symptoms can be typical childhood behaviors, so it can be hard to know what’s ADHD-related and what’s not."
28,ADHD,ADHD in adults,"More than60% of childrenwith ADHD still showsymptoms as adults. For many people, hyperactivity symptoms often decrease with age, but inattentiveness and impulsivity may continue. That said, treatment is important. Untreated ADHD in adults can have a negative impact on many aspects of life. Symptoms such as difficulty managing time, forgetfulness, and impatience can cause problems at work, home, and in all types of relationships."
29,ADHD,Is ADHD a learning disability?,"While ADHD is a neurodevelopmental disorder, it’s not considered alearning disability. However, ADHD symptoms can make it harder for you to learn. Teachers can map out individual guidelines for students with ADHD to help relieve any effect on their learning. This may include allowing extra time for assignments and tests or developing a personal reward system. Neurotypicaldescribes someone who processes information in ways that are typical within their culture and among their peers. Neurodivergent describes people who process information differently. People with ADHD sometimes identify as neurodivergent, but ultimately, it’s a personal decision."
30,ADHD,Coexisting conditions,"People with ADHD may have other health conditions. Some ofthese conditionsresult from the challenges of living with ADHD. People with ADHD can find it hard to keep up with daily tasks, maintain relationships, and so on. This can increase the risk ofanxiety. People with ADHD aremore likelyto experience an anxiety disorder than those without ADHD. Common anxiety disorders include: separation anxiety, when you are afraid of being away from loved ones social anxiety, which can make you afraid of going to school or other places where people socialize generalized anxiety, when you’re afraid of bad things happening, of the future, and so on If you or your child has ADHD, you’re more likely to havedepressionas well. In one study from 2020, around50% of adolescentshadmajor depressionor an anxiety disorder compared with 35% of those who did not have ADHD. Other research suggests that up to53.3% of adultswith ADHD may also have depression. Though managing more than one condition can present added challenges, treatments are available for both. The treatments often overlap. Talk therapy can help treat both conditions. Certain antidepressants, such as bupropion, can sometimes help ease ADHD symptoms. Behavior and conduct disorders aremore commonamong children with ADHD than those without the condition. These disorders can arise when a person does not feel understood by those around them. Someone who does not feel understood may argue a lot, lose their temper, or purposely annoy others. These may be signs ofoppositional defiant disorder. Some people find they cannot help breaking rules or behaving aggressively toward others, maybe fighting, bullying, or perhaps taking things that do not belong to them. This is calledconduct disorder. Treatment is available for people who face these challenges. Experts recommend starting treatment early and making sure the treatment fits the needs of the person and their family. Some children with ADHD have a learning disorder that can make it additionally hard to carry out their study tasks. Examples includedyslexia, which makes reading difficult, or presents difficulties with numbers or writing. These challenges can make it hard for a child to cope at school. They can also worsen feelings of anxiety and depression. Getting help early is essential in trying to minimize the effects of these challenges."
31,ADHD,Tips for coping with ADHD,"For children, it can be helpful to focus on writing down homework assignments and keeping everyday items like toys and backpacks in assigned spots. For adults, staying organized with lists,planners, and automated reminders can be helpful. Learning more about ADHD in general can also help you learn how to manage it. Organizations likeChildren and Adults with Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (CHADD)or theAttention Deficit Disorder Association (ADDA)provide management tips as well as the latest research. A healthcare professional can provide more guidance on ways to manage your ADHD symptoms."
32,ADHD,The bottom line,"For children and adults, untreated ADHD can have a lasting effect on school, work, and relationships. Treatment is important and can help lessen the effects of the condition. Many people with ADHD enjoy fulfilling and successful lives. Some even express appreciation for the condition’s perceived benefits. An important first step is talking with a doctor or another healthcare professional. They can make a diagnosis and create a treatment plan to help you manage your symptoms and live well with ADHD."
33,Allergies,Overview,"Allergies occur when the immune system reacts to a typically harmless substance, leading to symptoms that can range from mild to severe. Common allergy symptoms include skin reactions, respiratory issues, and digestive problems, and can be managed through avoidance, medication, immunotherapy, and natural remedies. Anaphylaxis is a severe, life threatening allergic reaction requiring immediate treatment with an epinephrine auto-injector (EpiPen). The immune system is responsible for keeping you healthy by fighting harmful pathogens. It does this bycreating antibodiescalled immunoglobulin. There are several types of immunoglobulins, which fight against possible agents like bacteria, viruses, parasites, and chemicals. Immunoglobin E (IgE) is a type that responds to certain substances and causes an allergic reaction. Allergic reactions may involve a variety of symptoms, ranging from mild inflammation to life threatening situations. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),1 in 3 peoplehave an allergy in the United States. Keep reading to learn more about the types, symptoms, and causes of allergies, as well as how to treat them. Sometimes, allergic reactions may cause symptoms that could be life threatening, known asanaphylaxis. If you or someone you know suddenly experiences any of the following symptoms, call 911 or get immediate medical attention: swelling in the face, throat, and tongue dizziness, confusion, fainting difficulty breathing, swallowing, and speaking wheezing or coughing skin discoloration, such as blue, pale, or gray tongue If you or the person has an epinephrine autoinjector, use it immediately. The shot counters allergic reactions until medical help arrives and could be lifesaving. Learn more aboutwhat to do if someone has an allergic reaction."
34,Allergies,Types of allergies,"There are several types of allergies, according toAllergy UK. These include: food allergies hayfever(allergic rhinitis) asthma atopic dermatitis (eczema) skin allergies medication allergies insect bite allergies"
35,Allergies,Symptoms of allergies,"Symptoms of allergies may depend on several factors, such as the type and severity of your allergy. According to theAmerican College of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology (ACAAI), common allergy symptoms may include: congestion runny nose sneezing coughing fatigue headaches rashes, such as hives nausea vomiting fever wheezing difficulty breathing Learn more about themost common allergy symptoms. Certain skin symptoms may indicate an allergic reaction. For instance, you may experience tingling in your mouth after eating a food you’re allergic to. Or, you may experience an allergic reaction if your skin comes into direct contact with an allergen, known ascontact dermatitis. Symptoms of skin allergies may include: rashes hives swollen, watery, or puffy eyes itching burning Learn more aboutallergy symptoms and what might cause them."
36,Allergies,Causes of allergies,"It’s still unclear why the immune system causes an allergic reaction when a normally harmless foreign substance enters the body. However, researchers have identified several factors that may contribute to allergies,including: older age genetics hormonal changes, especially in people assigned female at birth immunological factors, such as weakened immune system gut microbiome changes having other allergies, such as atopic dermatitis Several common allergens have also been identified, including foods, medications, and environmental irritants. The cause of allergies may depend on how you come into contact with it: Ingestion:Foodslike nuts, cow’s milk, sesame, fish, tree nuts, and shellfish may cause allergies. Some oral medications likepenicillinmay also trigger a reaction. Inhaling:Severalenvironmental irritants, such as pollution, pet dander,mold, pollen, anddust mites, can trigger allergies. Direct contact:Some allergies are caused by direct contact with allergens, such as insect stings, the sun, certain plants, latex, and certain metals."
37,Allergies,How allergies are diagnosed,"A doctor will first ask about your symptoms and perform a physical exam. They may ask about anything unusual you may have eaten recently and any substances you may have come in contact with. For example, if you have a rash on your hands, they may ask if you put on latex gloves recently. To confirm an allergy, they may order several tests,including: Blood test:This can help detect the presence of IgE, which are cells that react to allergens. Skin prick test:Small amounts of an allergen are pricked, brushed, or scratched against your skin to see if there’s an allergic reaction. Learn more aboutallergy testing and diagnosis."
38,Allergies,Allergy treatments,"Avoiding the allergen that triggers the reaction is the best way to prevent allergies. If that’s not possible, there are treatment options available. Allergy treatment usually includes over-the-counter or prescription medications, whichare availableas nasal sprays, pills, liquids, and topical ointments. Some allergy medications mayinclude: antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl), loratadine (Claritin), andcetirizine(Zyrtec) corticosteroids decongestants(Afrin, Suphedrine PE, Sudafed) mast cell stabilizers, which stop mast cells from releasing histamine It’s important to work with a healthcare professional to develop the best management plan for your allergies.

Most allergies are manageable with avoidance, medications, and lifestyle changes. Working with a doctor can help reduce major complications and make life more enjoyable."
45,Antibiotics,Overview,"Antibiotics are medications used to fight infections caused by bacteria. They’re also called antibacterials. They treat infections by killing or decreasing the growth of bacteria. The first modern-day antibiotic was used in 1936. Before antibiotics,30 percentof all deaths in the United States were caused by bacterial infections. Thanks to antibiotics, previously fatal infections are curable. Today, antibiotics are still powerful, lifesaving medications for people with certain serious infections. They can also prevent less serious infections from becoming serious. There are many classes of antibiotics. Certain types of antibiotics work best for specific types of bacterial infections. Antibiotics come in many forms, including: tablets capsules liquids creams ointments Most antibiotics are only available with a prescription from your doctor. Some antibiotic creams and ointments are available over the counter."
46,Antibiotics,How do antibiotics work against bacteria?,Antibioticstreatbacterial infections either by killing bacteria or slowing and suspending its growth. They do this by: attacking the wall or coating surrounding bacteria interfering with bacteria reproduction blocking protein production in bacteria
47,Antibiotics,How long do antibiotics take to work?,"Antibiotics begin to work right after you start taking them. However, you might not feel better for 2 to 3 days. How quickly you get better after antibiotic treatment varies. It also depends on the type of infection you’re treating. Most antibiotics should be taken for7 to 14 days. In some cases, shorter treatments work just as well. Your doctor will decide the best length of treatment and correct antibiotic type for you. Even though you might feel better after a few days of treatment, it’s best to finish the entire antibiotic regimen in order to fully resolve your infection. This can also help prevent antibiotic resistance. Don’t stop your antibiotic regimen early unless your healthcare professional says you can do so."
48,Antibiotics,What are antibiotics made of?,"The first beta-lactam antibiotic,penicillin,was discoveredby accident. It was growing from a blob of mold on a petri dish. Scientists found that a certain type of fungus naturally produced penicillin. Eventually, penicillin was produced in large amounts in a laboratory through fermentation using the fungus. Some other early antibiotics were produced by bacteria found in ground soil. Today, all antibiotic medications are produced in a lab. Some are made through a series of chemical reactions that produce the substance used in the medication. Other antibiotics are at least partly made through a natural but controlled process. This process is often enhanced with certain chemical reactions that can alter the original substance to create a different medication."
49,Antibiotics,What is antibiotic resistance?,"Antibiotics are powerful medications that work very well for certain types of illnesses. However, some antibiotics are now less useful than they once were due to an increase in antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic resistance occurs when bacteria can no longer be controlled or killed by certain antibiotics. In some cases, this can mean there are no effective treatments for certain conditions. Each year, there aremore than 2.8 millioncases of bacterial infections that are resistant to antibiotics, resulting in at least 35,000 deaths. When you take an antibiotic, the sensitive bacteria are eliminated. The bacteria that survive during antibiotic treatment are often resistant to that antibiotic. These bacteria typically have unique characteristics that prevent antibiotics from working on them. Some serious antibiotic-resistant infections include: The overgrowth of this type of bacteria causes infection in both your small and large intestines. This often occurs after someone’s treated with antibiotics for a different bacterial infection.C. diffis naturally resistant to many antibiotics. Thesebacteriaoften infect your bloodstream, urinary tract, or surgical wounds. This infection typically occurs in people who are hospitalized. Enterococci infections may be treated with the antibiotic vancomycin, but VRE is resistant to this treatment. This type of infection is resistant to traditional staph infection antibiotics.MRSA infectionstypically occur on your skin. It’s most common in people in hospitals and those with weakened immune systems. This class of bacteria are resistant to a lot of other antibiotics. CRE infections typically occur in people in hospitals and who are on a mechanical ventilator or have indwelling catheters. The most important cause of antibiotic resistance is inappropriate use or overuse of antibiotics. As much as28 percentof antibiotic use is thought to be unnecessary. This is because antibiotics are often prescribed when they aren’t needed. Several important steps can be taken to decrease inappropriate antibiotic use: Take antibiotics only for bacterial infections.Don’t use antibiotics for conditions caused by viruses such as the common cold, flu, cough, or sore throat. Take antibiotics as directed by a healthcare professional.Using the wrong dose, skipping doses, or taking it longer or shorter than directed might contribute to bacteria resistance. Even if you feel better after a few days, talk with your healthcare professional before discontinuing an antibiotic. Take the right antibiotic.Using the wrong antibiotic for an infection might lead to resistance. Don’t take antibiotics prescribed for someone else. Also, don’t take antibiotics left over from a previous treatment. Your healthcare professional will be able to select the most appropriate antibiotic for your specific type of infection."
50,Antibiotics,What are antibiotics used to treat?,"Antibiotics are used for treating infections caused by bacteria. Sometimes it’s difficult to determine if your infection is caused by bacteria or a virus because the symptoms are often very similar. Your healthcare professional will evaluate your symptoms and conduct a physical exam to determine the cause of your infection. In some cases, they may request a blood or urine test to confirm the cause of infection. Some common bacterial infections include: urinary tract infections (UTIs) sinusandear infections strep throat Antibiotics aren’t effective against viruses, such as thecommon coldorflu. They also don’t work on infections caused by fungi, such as: yeast infections athlete’s foot fungaltoenail infections ringworm These are treated with a different group of medications calledantifungals."
51,Antibiotics,What are common side effects of antibiotics?,"Most antibiotics have similar side effects. Perhaps the most common side effect is gastrointestinal (GI) upset,including: diarrhea nausea vomiting cramps In some cases, these side effects can be reduced if you take the antibiotic with food. However, some antibiotics must be taken on an empty stomach. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about the best way to take your antibiotic. GI upset usually goes away after you stop treatment. If it doesn’t, you should call your doctor. Also call your doctor if you develop: severe diarrhea stomach pain and cramping blood in your stool fever"

79,Aromatherapy,The bottom line,"As you explore the uses of essential oils, pay attention to how the different oils and methods of use affect you. Always talk to your doctor before starting any aromatherapy treatment. Remember that aromatherapy is meant to be a complementary therapy. It’s not meant to replace any doctor-approved treatment plan."
80,Arrhythmia,Overview,"Arrhythmias are irregularities in the heart’s rhythm, such as beating too fast, too slow, or erratically. While some are harmless, others can lead to organ damage or be life threatening. Various factors, including heart conditions, genetics, lifestyle choices, and certain medications, can cause arrhythmias. Diagnosis involves a comprehensive evaluation, including medical history, physical exams, and tests like ECGs and heart monitors. These help doctors determine the appropriate treatment strategy, which can range from lifestyle changes like diet changes to medications or surgical procedures."
81,Arrhythmia,What is arrhythmia?,"An arrhythmia is a disorder of theheartthat affects the rate or rhythm at which the heart beats; basically the way the electricity works. It happens when electrical impulses that direct and regulate heartbeats don’t function properly. This causes the heart to beat: too fast (tachycardia) too slow (bradycardia) too early (premature contraction) too erratically (fibrillation) The prevalence of arrhythmia is between1.5 and 5 percentof the population. It may feel like your heart is racing or fluttering. Or you may not feel different at all. Arrhythmias can be common and usually harmless, but some can be problematic. When an arrhythmia interferes with blood flow to your body, it can damage your: brain lungs heart other vital organs If they’re not treated, arrhythmias may be life threatening. Dysrhythmiais another name for arrhythmia. While there’s a slight medical distinction between the two, both are often used interchangeably to refer to an irregular heartbeat."
82,Arrhythmia,Types of arrhythmia,"Arrhythmiasare named and categorized based on three factors: rate, whether it’s too slow or too fast origin, whether it’s in the ventricles or the atria regularity In a properly beating heart, electrical impulses follow precise pathways through the heart. These signals coordinate the activity of the heart muscle so that blood pumps in and out of the heart. Any interruption in these pathways or impulses can cause the heart to beat abnormally, leading to arrhythmia. These can start in the sinus node, the ventricles (the heart’s lower chambers), or the atria (the upper chambers). Categories of arrhythmia can include: bradycardia, in which the heart rate is too slow tachycardia, in which the heart rate is too fast ventricular arrhythmia, which begins in the ventricles supraventricular arrhythmia, which begins above the ventricles premature heartbeat, in which the heart has an extra beat Bradycardia occurs when your heart rate slows to under 60 beats per minute. Conditions that cause a slow heart rate can include: heart block sick sinus syndrome Sinus arrhythmia is one type of sick sinus syndrome, a group of disorders related to the sinus node. This condition can be present from birth or develop as the result of another condition, such as congenital heart disease or sleep apnea. Tachycardia occurs when your heart rate speeds up to more than 100 beats per minute. This rapid heartbeat can affect the way your heart pumps blood. Your ventricles may not be able to fill with the necessary amount of blood to pump to the rest of your body. Typically, if this condition lasts only a few minutes, it may not be serious. However, you may need immediate medical attention if it lasts longer than30 minutesor is accompanied by chest pain. Ventricular arrhythmias begins in the ventricles, or the lower chambers, of the heart. Types of ventricular arrhythmias can include: ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation premature ventricular beats (PVCs), which are extra heartbeats that begin in the ventricles Torsades de Pointes, which is an uncommon but specific type of ventricular tachycardia that can be life threatening Both ventricular tachycardia and ventricular fibrillation may need to be treated immediately, especially if you have other heart conditions. Ventricular tachycardia (VT)typically occurs in people who have had heart disease or heart-related issues, likecoronary artery diseaseor a prior heart attack, but can occur in those with structurally normal hearts. It can cause a heart rate of 100 beats per minute or higher with the rhythm originating in the bottom chamber of the heart. VT is dangerous when it lasts longer than a few seconds. It may also lead to more serious ventricular arrhythmias, such as ventricular fibrillation. Ventricular fibrillation (VF)involves sudden, rapid, irregular, and chaotic heartbeats in the ventricle. These erratic electrical impulses, sometimes triggered by a heart attack, cause your heart’s ventricles to quiver. When you have this kind of arrhythmia, your ventricles can’t pump blood into your body, and your heart rate drops quickly. This can cause sudden cardiac arrest and death without immediate treatment. Atrial arrhythmias, also known as supraventricular arrhythmias, begin in the atrium or upper chamber of the heart above the ventricles. Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) includes different forms of arrhythmias that begin above the ventricles. SVTs are usually identified by a burst of rapid heartbeats that may begin and end suddenly. They can cause a sudden rapid heartbeat of over 100 beats per minute that typically lasts a few minutes but that may last longer, including up to several hours, according to theUK National Health Service (NHS). Types of supraventricular arrhythmia can include: atrial fibrillation atrial flutter atrial tachycardia atrioventricular nodal reentrant tachycardia (AVNRT) atrioventricular reeentrant tachycardia supraventricular tachycardia paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia(PSVT) Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome If you haveatrial fibrillation, also known as AF or AFib, your atria beat very rapidly, as fast as 400 beats per minute. The atria move so quickly that they aren’t able to contract completely. Instead, they quiver — or fibrillate — and the ventricular rate is usually fast as well. Your risk of developing AF increases past age 65 and if you have other medical conditions. If left untreated, AF can lead to more serious conditions, such as stroke. Inatrial flutter(AFl), the heart beats more rhythmic and constant than in atrial fibrillation. You may not feel any symptoms with either type of arrhythmia. Atrial flutter occurs most often in people with heart disease, though it’s less common than AF. It also can often show up in the first weeks after heart surgery. Like AF, atrial flutter can be life threatening. A premature heartbeat can also sometimes lead to arrhythmia if you have another heart condition. Premature heartbeats feel like your heart has skipped a beat. In reality, your normal heart rhythm has likely been interrupted by a too-soon beat, and you’re experiencing the beat after that early beat. The sinus node uses electrical impulses to help regulate your heartbeat’s rhythm. A sinus arrhythmia is a rhythm variation of the normalsinus rhythm. It is most often seen in children and young, healthy adults and, cantypicallyindicate good cardiovascular health. It happens sometimes when breathing stimulates the vagus nerve — a nerve that shares information from the organs with the brain. This can result in beat-to-beat differences in the resting heart rate. When not associated with breathing, sinus arrhythmia can indicate an underlying condition. Scarring near the sinus node fromheart diseaseor a heart attack may slow down or block the electrical impulses as they travel through the heart. This can cause arrhythmia and other cardiovascular disorders. Sinus arrhythmia is a common condition in many people. However, it may cause heart complications for some."
83,Arrhythmia,Arrhythmia symptoms,"You may not have any symptoms of an arrhythmia. However, common signs can include: feeling like your heart skipped abeat a fluttering feeling in your neck orchest rapid heartbeat slow or irregular heartbeat Talk to your doctor about your symptoms so they can effectively diagnose and treat your arrhythmia. You may also develop more serious symptoms from your heart not working properly, including: chest painor tightness difficulty breathing irregular pulse weakness dizziness orlightheadedness fainting, or almost fainting fatigue sweating heart palpitations low blood pressure Seek medical care right away if you experience any of these symptoms.Find out more about arrhythmia symptoms and when to seek care. Sometimes, arrhythmia is asymptomatic. You may not feel anything at all. Arrhythmia may also feel like your heart is beating irregularly, too fast, or too slow. You may feel a fluttering feeling in your chest."
84,Arrhythmia,Causes,"Arrhythmias can have medical, physical, emotional, or genetic causes. The cause may also be unknown. Antibiotics and other medications can trigger arrhythmia in some people. These may include medications that treat: high blood pressure depression allergies colds Changes in blood flow or physical alterations to the heart, such as scarring, can also cause arrhythmia. Other medical conditions may also be the source. They can include: high blood pressure dehydration thyroid disorder sleep apnea diabetes electrolyte imbalance, such as from low levels of calcium, potassium, or magnesium anemia Other physical or lifestyle factors can also cause arrhythmia in some cases. These can include: exercise coughing strong emotions like anger, stress,or anxiety drinkingalcohol smoking"
85,Arrhythmia,Risk factors,"Having certain risk factors may increase the chances of developing arrhythmias. However, not all people who have these risk factors develop irregular heart rhythms. Somerisk factors for arrhythmiaare related to medical conditions. Others may be related to genetics, certain behaviors, or medications. Conditions that may increase your risk for developing arrhythmia can include: coronary artery disease heart valve disease heart attack orheart failure cardiomyopathy(heart muscle diseases) endocarditis(heart inflammation) high blood pressure sleep apnea chronic lung disease overactive or underactive thyroid gland kidney disease eating disorders that cause an electrolyte imbalance or malnutrition fever diabetes Other common risk factors for arrhythmia can include: older age certain medications, especially stimulants and antihistamines, some of which can be purchased over the counter air pollution family history of arrhythmia caffeine alcohol smoking street drugs, particularlycocaineor amphetamines Making certain lifestyle changes, such as reducing your consumption of caffeine, alcohol, and drugs, may reduce your risk of developing arrhythmia."
86,Arrhythmia,Diagnosis,"Doctors may use a variety oftests to diagnose arrhythmia. These tests may also help determine why you are experiencing an irregular heartbeat. This information can help guide your treatment. The following tests may be used to help a doctor reach a diagnosis: your medical and family history aphysical exam a range of tests to diagnose arrhythmias, including an electrocardiogram (ECG) a Holter monitor, a wearable ECG device that can be worn at home or during daily activities In addition to an ECG, a doctor may also use achest X-rayorechocardiogramto check: the size and shape of your heart the condition of the valves that help regulate the flow of blood through your heart A doctor may also use additional tests to check for arrhythmias. These can include: Stress test.Astress testallows a doctor to monitor your heartbeat while you exercise to see if exertion causes an arrhythmia. They can also use medication to increase your heart rate for the test if you have trouble exercising. Sleep study.Asleep studycan show whether sleep apnea is the source of your arrhythmia. Tilt table test.A tilt table test may be used if your arrhythmia has caused you to faint in the past. The doctor will check your heart rate and blood pressure as you lie on a table that’s tilted between different positions. Electrophysiological testing.A doctor will insert thin electrode catheters through your veins to different areas on your heart to map electrical signals during electrophysiological testing. The electrodes cause different parts of the heart to contract, which may help the doctor diagnose an arrhythmia and suggest treatment. Blood tests.A doctor may also order blood tests to check the levels of substances, such as magnesium, calcium, and thyroid hormones, that may affect arrhythmia. Anelectrocardiogram, also called an ECG or EKG, is frequently used to diagnose arrhythmia. The doctor attaches electrodes to your chest, arms, or legs that measure and graph your heart’s electrical activity. ECG measurements reveal if the electrical activity is unusually fast, slow, or irregular. The test can also show if your heart is enlarged or has poor blood flow. A doctor may take an ECG while you’re resting or while you’re exercising on a stationary bicycle or treadmill. A portable monitor can also take ECGs to look for irregularities over a longer period of time. ECGs involve little or no risk. Since arrhythmias can be irregular and may not occur while you’re at the doctor’s office, a doctor may have you use a heart monitor at home to help diagnose the conditions. Types of heart monitors can include: Holter monitor.AHolter monitoris a portable monitor that records your heart’s rhythm over the course of 1 or 2 days but can be up to 14 days. Event recorders.Event recorders are handheld monitors that can be used to record your heartbeat when you feel an irregularity. Implantable loop recorder.A doctor may implant a loop recorder under your skin to continuously monitor your heartbeat and record infrequent arrhythmias."
87,Arrhythmia,Treatment,"Arrhythmias sometimes don’t need specific treatment, but it’s important to have your arrhythmia medically evaluated. A doctor will evaluate whether your arrhythmia may cause more serious symptoms or other conditions when deciding on treatment options. It’s important to exercise, maintain a healthy diet, and manage your blood pressure andcholesterol levelswhen you have an arrhythmia. This can lower your risk for complications like aheart attackorstroke. If you experience a fast heart rate without any other symptoms, a doctor may suggest that you tryvagal maneuvers. They can prompt yourvagus nerveto slow your heart rate. Vagal maneuvers can include: soaking your face with cold water coughing gagging holding your breath while straining Other treatments for arrhythmia may include medication and surgery. A doctor may give you medication to help you manage your arrhythmia and prevent complications like a heart attack. Most of the medications come in pill form, but some may come in intranasal or intravenous form for use during an emergency. The medication they prescribe depends on the type of arrhythmia as well as other conditions you may have. Common medication types include: Calcium channel blockers.Calcium channel blockers, which can include amlodipine (Norvasc) and diltiazem (Cardizem CD), help lower your blood pressure and heart rate. They can be used long term. Beta-blockers.Beta-blockersslow your heart rate to treat tachycardia. Beta-blockers may include acebutolol (Sectral), metoprolol (Lopressor, Toprol XL), and other medications. Antiarrhythmic drugs.Antiarrhythmic drugscan treat tachycardia and premature heartbeats. They can include amiodarone (Pacerone, Nexterone), propafenone (Rythmol SR), flecainide (Tambocor), and more. However, they may cause the problematic side effect of proarrhythmia, which can potentially worsen your arrhythmia or cause a new arrhythmia. Anticoagulants.Anticoagulantshelp prevent blood clots, which can result from atrial fibrillation. Blood-thinning medications include warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven), rivaroxaban (Xarelto), and more. A side effect may be excessive or internal bleeding. Make sure to take medications as prescribed. Let your doctor know about side effects, especially any new arrhythmias or worsening of your existing arrhythmia. If medication or other treatments aren’t enough to help your arrhythmia, you may need a minor procedure or surgery. Several procedures and implantable devices may help treat arrhythmia: Catheter ablation:Duringcatheter ablation, a cardiologist threads flexible tubes called catheters through your blood vessels to the correct area of your heart. An electrode at the end of one of the catheters releases radiofrequency waves, heat, or cold temperatures to create a small scar. The scar tissue blocks the electrical waves that cause arrhythmias. Pacemaker:A doctor can implant apacemakerduring minor surgery. After making a small cut near your shoulder, they guide small wires through your veins and place them in your heart. The wires connect to a small battery-powered generator implanted near your collarbone. If the generator detects an abnormal heart rhythm, it can send an electrical pulse through the wire to help regulate it. Implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD):AnICDis similar to a pacemaker and may be implanted near your collarbone, breastbone, or ribs. It may help if your arrhythmias are life threatening or put you at risk ofcardiac arrest. An ICD can send electric shocks to your heart to correct its rhythm or restart your heart if it stops beating. Surgery can also treat serious types of arrhythmias, such as atrial fibrillation. In themaze procedure, your surgeon makes small cuts on the upper half of your heart to create scar tissue. The scars block electrical activity that can cause irregular heart rhythms. Making lifestyle changes at home, including getting regular exercise and eating healthy foods, can help improve your heart health and help you manage arrhythmia. Othercomplementary treatmentsmay help arrhythmia, though more research is needed. According to a2020 research review, yoga may help reduce arrhythmia burden and blood pressure and benefit heart rate. The authors suggest that this may be due to an increase in the tone of the vagal nerve and a reduction in fluctuations in blood pressure. However, more research is needed to support this. Acupuncture may also be an effective treatment for arrhythmia, according to a2017 research review. However, the review noted that current research is limited. Two researchreviewspublished in2017suggested thatmagnesiumandvitamin C supplementsmay reduce or prevent atrial fibrillation after heart surgery. Still, there isn’t enough evidence to recommend supplements for arrhythmias. Discuss anyalternative treatments for arrhythmia, especially supplements, with a doctor."
88,Arrhythmia,Complications,"Different types of arrhythmias, especially when untreated, may lead to life threatening conditions. These complications include: heart failure stroke dementia cardiac arrest arrhythmias that get worse or cause other symptoms A2021 meta-analysisof 18 studies suggests that atrial fibrillation is associated with dementia and Alzheimer’s disease risk.A 2020 nationwide cohort studyin South Korea suggests that catheter ablation may help reduce that risk."
89,Arrhythmia,Prevention,"Arrhythmias can develop from a variety of causes, some of which you may not be able to prevent. Still, you can work to avoid triggering your arrhythmia or making it worse. First, it’s important to understand the cause of your arrhythmia so you can avoid behaviors and substances that may trigger the condition. Arrhythmia triggers that can be prevented may include: stress/anxiety smoking caffeine alcohol certain medications some street drugs Talk to your doctor if you think any medications are causing your arrhythmia. Don’t stop or change your medication on your own. Certain healthy practices can also help manage andprevent arrhythmia. These practices can include: following aheart-healthy dietwith reduced salt and fat quitting smoking exercising regularly maintaining ahealthy BMI reducingstress limiting alcohol maintain healthyblood pressureandcholesterol levels Develop a plan with your doctor to help manage your arrhythmia, including steps you can take when you have symptoms."
90,Arrhythmia,Outlook,"Arrhythmia can occur without symptoms or side effects. Arrhythmia can occur as part of an inherited or other health condition. Some types of arrhythmia may be more serious and potentially life threatening. The outlook depends on the type and severity of the arrhythmia along with your other health conditions. If you think you may have an arrhythmia, consult with a doctor for diagnosis and treatment. More serious arrhythmias may be treated with medication or surgery. Most people with arrhythmia can live a normal life."
91,Arrhythmia,The bottom line,"Heart arrhythmias are common and many people experience them. Sometimes, they may occur without other symptoms and leave no lasting effects. It’s also normal to have an increased heart rate during exercise, when your heart is working hard to provide your tissues with oxygen-rich blood so you don’t get tired too quickly. However, some types of arrhythmias can be severe and require medical attention. It’s important to get diagnosed to determine the best plan for treatment."
92,Arthritis,Overview,"Arthritis refers to a range of conditions involving joint inflammation. There are over 100 types, each with different symptoms that can emerge gradually or suddenly. Common arthritis symptoms include joint pain, stiffness, and swelling, which can worsen in the morning or after resting. Treatment focuses on reducing pain and preventing joint damage through medication, physical therapy, lifestyle measures, and, in some cases, surgery. There aremore than100 different types of arthritis, with different causes and treatment methods. Osteoarthritis (OA) is themost common type of arthritisin the United States.Other common typesinclude: rheumatoid arthritis (RA) psoriatic arthritis (PsA) gout The typical age for developing rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is between ages 30 and 50. It can, however, affect children, teens, and younger adults. Osteoarthritis (OA) commonly develops after the age 50 or 60 years, but there are studies that reveal radiographic evidence of OA occurring in women in their 40s. It also tends to be more prevalent in individuals who are overweight."
93,Arthritis,What are the symptoms of arthritis?,"Joint pain, stiffness, and swelling arethe most common symptomsof arthritis. Your symptoms may also feel worse in the morning when you get out of bed or upon standing up after you’ve been resting. Other symptoms of osteoarthritisinclude: limited range of motion that sometimes goes away after movement clicking or popping with bending muscle weakness around the joint instability or buckling of the joint bony growths in the fingers grating or scraping feeling in the knees Other symptoms of rheumatoid arthritisinclude: morning stiffness that can last 30 minutes or more more than one affected joint onset in smaller joints like feet and hands same joints on both sides of the body are affected fatigue low-grade fever inflammation of the eyes and mouth inflammation of the heart muscle and blood vessels low red blood cell count"
94,Arthritis,What causes arthritis?,"Arthritis may becaused by: wear and tear of a joint from overuse age (OA is most common in adults overage 50) injuries obesity autoimmune disorders genes or family history muscle weakness Normal wear and tear causesOA, one of the most common forms of arthritis. An infection or injury to the joints can exacerbate this natural breakdown of cartilage tissue. Cartilageis a firm but flexible connective tissue in your joints. It protects the joints by absorbing the pressure and shock created when you move and put stress on them. A reduction in the normal amount of this cartilage tissue causes some forms of arthritis. Your risk of developing OAmayalso be higher if you have a family history of the disease. Another common form of arthritis,RA, is anautoimmune disorder. It occurs when your body’s immune system attacks the tissues of the body, resulting in inflammation to joints as well as other body organs. In the joints, this inflammatory response affects the synovium, a soft tissue in your joints that produces a fluid that nourishes the cartilage and lubricates the joints, eventually destroying both bone and cartilage inside the joint. The exactcause of the immune system’s attacksis unknown. But scientists have discovered genetic markers that increase your risk ofdeveloping RA fivefold."
95,Arthritis,How is arthritis diagnosed?,"Seeing your primary care physician is a good first step if you’re unsure who to see for an arthritis diagnosis. Theywill performa physical exam to check for fluid around the joints, warm or red joints, and document the range of motion in the joints. Your doctor can refer you to a specialist if needed. If you’re experiencing severe symptoms, you may choose to schedule an appointment with arheumatologistfirst. This may lead to a faster diagnosis and treatment. Documenting inflammation levels in your blood and aspirating and analyzing joint fluids, if present, can help your doctor determine what kind of arthritis you have. Blood tests that check for specific types of antibodies like anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (CCP),rheumatoid factor (RF)andantinuclear antibody (ANA)are also common diagnostic tests. Doctors commonly use imaging scans such asX-ray,MRI, andCT scansto produce an image of your bones and cartilage. This helps them rule out other causes of your symptoms, such asbone spurs. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
96,Arthritis,How is arthritis treated?,"The main goal of treatment is to reduce the amount of pain you’re experiencing and prevent additional damage to the joints. You’ll learn what works best for you in terms of managing pain. In general, treatment for arthritisinvolvesa combination of: medications and supplements physical therapy occupational therapy nutrient-rich diet regular exercise weight loss, if needed heat and cold compresses mobility assistance devices, such as canes or walkers Improving your joint function is also important. Your doctor may prescribe a combination of treatment methods to achieve the best results. A number of differenttypesof medication treat arthritis: Analgesics, such as hydrocodone (Vicodin) oracetaminophen(Tylenol), are effective for pain management, but do not help decrease inflammation. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such asibuprofen(Advil) and salicylates, help manage pain and inflammation. Salicylates can thin the blood, so they should not be used with additional blood thinning medications. Menthol or capsaicincreams. Thesecreamsblock the transmission of pain signals from your joints. Steroids,likeprednisone, help reduce inflammation but should be used cautiously and for brief periods of time. Immunosuppressantsand biologics.Immunosuppressantsandbiologicsare prescribed for moderate to severe inflammatory arthritis like RA. If you have RA, your doctor may recommend corticosteroids ordisease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), which suppress your immune system. DMARDs and biologics are being prescribed earlier in the course of RA. Methotrexate is now a first-line drug for treatment. There are also many medications to treat OA available over the counter or by prescription. Whileclinical evidence and safety dataare lacking for many herbs and supplements marketed for arthritis, therearea few supplements that may be beneficial. For example, avocado and soybean unsaponifiables (ASU) may help OA symptoms.Fish oilandturmericsupplementsmay help reduce inflammation in RA. However, you should talk with your doctor before takinganysupplements for arthritis to make sure they are safe for you and will not interact with any medications you’re currently taking. Surgery to replace your joint with an artificial one may be an option. This form of surgery is most commonly performed to replacehipsandknees. If your arthritis is most severe in yourfingersorwrists, your doctor may perform joint fusion. In this procedure, the ends of your bones are fused, eliminating the joint and therefore eliminating the site of inflammation. Physical therapy involving exercises that help strengthen the muscles around the affected joint is a core component of arthritis treatment. Outside of your appointments, your physical therapist will likely recommend a plan of care that includes daily movement along with exercises you can complete on your own at home. Collectively, these can help build strength, flexibility, and balance to improve mobility while also preventing falls."
97,Arthritis,What lifestyle changes can help people with arthritis?,"Losing any excess weightand maintaining a moderate weightreduces the riskof developing OA and can reduce symptoms if you already have the condition. Eating a nutrient-dense diet is important for weight loss. Choosing a diet with lots ofantioxidants, such as fresh fruits, vegetables, and herbs, can help reduce inflammation. Otherinflammation-reducing foodsinclude fish and nuts. Foods that should be limited or avoided if you have arthritis include: fried foods processed foods dairy products a high intake of meat Someresearchalso suggests that gluten antibodies may be present in people with RA. Agluten-free dietmay improve symptoms and disease progression. A2015 studyalso recommends a gluten-free diet for all people who receive a diagnosis of undifferentiatedconnective tissue disease. Regular exercisecan keep your joints flexible. Swimming is often a good form of exercise for people with arthritis because it does not put pressure on your joints the way running and walking do. Staying active is important, but listening to your body when it’s signally resting and avoidingoverexertingyourself are just as essential. At-home exercises you can try include: the head tilt, neck rotation, and other exercises to relievepain in your neck finger bends and thumb bends to easepain in your hands leg raises,hamstring stretches, and othereasy exercises for knee arthritis"
98,Arthritis,Complications,"When left untreated, symptoms of arthritis may worsen and affect your day-to-day life. Below are some of the possible complications associated with this condition: Reduced mobility.As arthritis progresses, you may experience less comfortable movement. This can interfere with your daily routine and may keep you from your favorite activities as well as socializing. Possible weight gain.This is attributed to decreased movements, as well as discomfort thatkeeps you from exercising. Increased risk of metabolic disorders.Being overweight with an inflammatory condition like arthritis mayincrease your chancesof developingtype 2 diabetes,high blood pressure,high cholesterol, andheart disease. Inflammation in other areas of your body.If your arthritis is attributed to an autoimmune disease like with RA, the inflammationcan spread and affectyour skin, eyes, blood vessels, and lungs. Risk of falls.According to theArthritis Foundation, people with OA are more likely to experience falls and possible fractures. This is primarily caused by related muscle weakness, but dizziness from pain medications can also lead to falls. Decreased ability to work.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that about60 percentof people with arthritis are working age. Arthritis may affect your ability to move around in the workplace or even get from your mode of transportation to your job site. Effects on mental health.Arthritis mayincrease the riskof anxiety and depression due toongoing pain, inflammation, and social isolation."
99,Arthritis,Risk factors,"The overallrisk factors for arthritisinclude: Obesity.Particularly associated with OA, being overweight puts added stress on weight-bearing joints in the body, such as your knees and hips. Losing excess weight can help reduce your risk of developing arthritis, and it may also help if you already have the condition. Age and gender.The risk of developing arthritis increases with age. Also,women are more likelythan men to develop most forms of arthritis. The exception isgout, which is more prominent in men. Overuse injuries.Repetitive stress injuries incurred during exercise, your job, or other activities may increase your risk of developing OA in the affected joint(s) later in life. Your genes.A family history of autoimmune diseases as well as certain inherited genes may increase your risk of RA and other related types of arthritis. Smoking.Your risk of developing RAmay increase if you smoke, and smoking can in turn make this autoimmune disease worse."
100,Arthritis,What is the long-term outlook for people with arthritis?,"While there’s no cure for arthritis, the right treatment can greatly reduce your symptoms. In addition to the treatments your doctor recommends, you can make a number of lifestyle changes that may also help you manage your arthritis."
101,Asthma,Overview,"Asthma is an inflammatory disease affecting the airways to the lungs, making breathing difficult and physical activities challenging. Common asthma symptoms include wheezing, coughing (especially at night or during exercise), chest tightness, and shortness of breath. While there’s no cure for asthma, effective treatments can help decrease symptoms and improve quality of life. Asthma is an inflammatory disease that can affect the airways to your lungs. It makes breathing difficult and can make some physical activities challenging or even impossible. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),about 25 million peoplein the United States have asthma. It’s the most common chronic lung condition among children in the United States: In 2018, the CDC reported that about1 of every 12 childrenhad asthma. To understand asthma, it’s necessary to know a little about what happens when you breathe. Usually, with every breath you take, air goes through your nose or mouth, down into your throat, and into your airways, eventually reaching your lungs. There are lots of small air passages in your lungs that help deliver oxygen from the air to your bloodstream. Asthma symptoms happen when the lining of your airways swells and the muscles around them tighten. Mucus then fills your airways, further reducing the amount of air that can pass through. These effects can bring on an asthma “attack,” which involves the coughing and chest tightness that are typical of asthma."
102,Asthma,Symptoms,"Themost common symptom of asthmais wheezing — a squealing or whistling sound that happens when you breathe. Other possible asthma symptoms include: coughing, especially at night, when laughing, or during exercise tightness in your chest shortness of breath difficulty talking anxiety or panic fatigue chest pain rapid breathing frequent infections trouble sleeping The type of asthma you have can determine which symptoms you experience. Some people experience symptoms consistently throughout the day. Others may find that certain activities make their symptoms worse. But not everyone with asthma will experience these particular symptoms. If you think the symptoms you’re experiencing could be related to a condition such as asthma, make an appointment to see a healthcare professional. If you have asthma, remember that even if your condition is well managed, you may occasionally have a flare-up of symptoms. Flare-ups often decrease with the use of quick-acting treatments, such as inhalers, but may require medical attention in severe cases. Symptoms of an asthma flare-up may include: coughing wheezing throat clearing difficulty sleeping chest pain or tightness fatigue If your symptoms worsen or don’t improve with the use of an inhaler, you should seek immediate medical treatment. You should also seek treatment if you have symptoms of an asthma emergency, such as: severe trouble breathing gasping for air confusion pale or blue lips or fingernails dizziness difficulty walking or talking If you or someone around you is experiencing symptoms of an asthma emergency, call 911 or your local emergency number or go to the nearest emergency department."
103,Asthma,Causes and triggers,"Although asthma is especially common in children, many people don’t develop asthma until adulthood. Health experts havenot identifieda specific cause of asthma. Instead, researchers believe it’s caused by a variety of factors, including: Genetics:If your parent or sibling has asthma, you’re more likely to develop it. History of viral infections:People with a history of severe viral infections during childhood, such as respiratory syncytial virus infection (RSV), may be more likely to develop asthma. Hygiene hypothesis:When babies are not exposed to enough bacteria in their early months and years, their immune systems may not become strong enough to fight off asthma and other allergic conditions. Many factors can also trigger asthma, causing the symptoms to worsen. Triggers for asthma can vary, and some people may be more sensitive to certain triggers than others. The most common triggersinclude: health conditions such as respiratory infections exercise environmental irritants allergens intense emotions extreme weather conditions pests certain medications,includingaspirin and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)"
104,Asthma,Types of asthma,"Your doctor will need to determine thetype of asthmayou have. The most common type isallergic asthma, which accounts for60%of all cases of asthma. Some types of asthma are related to your stage of life. While asthma can appear at any age, pediatric asthma specifically affects children, and adult-onset asthma doesn’tbeginuntil adulthood. The sections below describe other specific types of asthma. This common type of asthma is triggered by allergens, including: pet dander from animals such as cats and dogs food mold pollen dust Allergic asthma is often seasonal because it goes hand-in-hand with seasonal allergies. Irritants in the air that are not related to allergies trigger this type of asthma. These irritants might include: burning wood cigarette smoke cold air air pollution viral illnesses air fresheners household cleaning products perfumes Occupational asthma is triggered by irritants in the workplace, such as: dust dyes gases and fumes industrial chemicals animal proteins rubber latex These irritants can exist in a wide range of industries, including: farming textiles woodworking manufacturing EIB usually affects people within a few minutes of starting exercise and can last until 10–15 minutes after physical activity. This condition was previously called exercise-induced asthma. Up to 90%of people with asthma also experience EIB, but not everyone with EIB will have other types of asthma. Aspirin-induced asthma (AIA), or aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease, is usually severe. It’s triggered by taking aspirin or another NSAID, such as naproxen (Aleve) or ibuprofen (Advil). The symptoms may begin within minutes or hours. People with AIA also typically have nasal polyps. About 9% of peoplewith asthma have AIA. It usually develops suddenly in adults ages 20–50 years. In this type of asthma, symptoms worsen at night. Triggers that might bring on symptoms at night include: heartburn pet dander dust mites Your body’s natural sleep cycle may also trigger nocturnal asthma. CVA doesn’t cause the classic asthma symptoms of wheezing and shortness of breath. Instead, it involves a persistent dry cough. However, if it’s not treated, CVA can lead to full-blown asthma flares that include the more common symptoms."
105,Asthma,Diagnosis,"No single test or exam can determine whether you or your child has asthma. Instead, healthcare professionals will use a variety of criteria to find out whether your symptoms are the result of asthma. The following steps can help healthcare professionalsdiagnoseasthma: Health history:Tell your doctor if you have family members with asthma, since this can mean you have a greater chance of developing it. Physical exam:Your doctor will listen to your breathing with a stethoscope. They may also perform a skin test to look for signs of an allergic reaction, such as hives or eczema. Allergies increase your risk for asthma. Breathing tests:Pulmonary function tests measure the airflow into and out of your lungs. For the most common test, spirometry, you blow into a device that measures the speed of the air. Doctors don’t typically perform breathing tests in children under 5 years of age because it’s difficult to get an accurate reading. Instead, they may prescribe asthma medications to your child and wait to see whether their symptoms improve. If your child’s symptoms improve with medication, your child likely has asthma. Your doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator or another asthma medication if your test results indicate asthma. If your symptoms improve with the use of this medication, your doctor will continue to treat your condition as asthma."
106,Asthma,Treatment,"To help treat asthma, theNational Asthma Education and Prevention Program (NAEPP)classifies the condition based on its severity before treatment. Asthma classificationsinclude: Intermittent:Most people have this type of asthma, which doesn’t interfere with daily activities. Symptoms are mild, occurring fewer than 2 days per week or 2 nights per month. Mild persistent:The symptoms occur more than twice per week, but not daily, and up to 4 nights per month. Moderate persistent:The symptoms occur daily and at least 1 night every week, but not nightly. They may limit some daily activities. Severe persistent:The symptoms occur several times every day and most nights, and they greatly limit your daily activities. Treatments for asthma fall intofourprimary categories: quick-relief medications long-term control medications a combination of quick-relief and long-term control medications, which is recommended by the most recentasthma clinical guidelines(released in 2020 by the NAEPP) butnot yet approvedby the Food and Drug Administration biologics, which are given by injection or infusion and typically used for only severe forms of asthma Your doctor will recommend one treatment or a combination of treatments based on: the type of asthma you have your age your triggers Your treatment plan may also involve learning your triggers, carefully monitoring your symptoms, and taking steps to avoid flare-ups. These medications should be used only in the event of asthma symptoms or an attack. They provide quick relief to help you breathe again. Bronchodilators work within minutes to relax the tightened muscles around your airways and quickly decrease your symptoms. Although they can come in the form of an oral medication or injection, bronchodilators are most commonly taken with an inhaler (rescue) or nebulizer. Your doctor may recommend that you use them to treat sudden asthma symptoms or take them before exercise to prevent a flare-up. If you think someone you know is having an asthma attack, tell them to sit them upright and help them use their rescue inhaler or nebulizer. The dosage will depend on the medication. Check the instructions insert to make sure you knowhow many puffsof medications you need in the event of an attack. If symptoms persist for more than20 minutesand a second round of medication doesn’t help, seek emergency medical attention. If you need to use quick-relief medications frequently, ask your doctor about another type of medication for long-term asthma control. You can take these medications daily to help reduce the number and severity of asthma symptoms. But they don’t manage the immediate symptoms of an attack. Long-term asthma control medicationsinclude: Anti-inflammatories:Taken with an inhaler, corticosteroids and other anti-inflammatory medications help reduce swelling and mucus production in your airways, making it easier to breathe. Anticholinergics:These help stop your muscles from tightening around your airways. They’re usually taken daily in combination with anti-inflammatories. Long-acting bronchodilators:These should be used only in combination with anti-inflammatory asthma medications. Doctors use biologics to treat severe asthma that doesn’t respond to other medications or to treatment by trigger management. Theyworkby targeting specific antibodies in your body, disrupting the pathway that leads to asthma-causing inflammation. There are five types of biologic medications on the market, and others are in development. You can receive this type of medication either as an injection or as an infusion in your doctor’s office. This treatment uses an electrode to heat the airways inside your lungs, helping to reduce the size of the surrounding muscle and prevent it from tightening. A doctor will perform this minimally invasive procedure in a clinic or hospital. It usually takes about an hour. Bronchial thermoplasty is intended for people with severe asthma and can provide relief from symptoms for up to5 years. However, because it’s a relatively new procedure, it’s not yet widely available."
107,Asthma,What is an asthma attack?,"When your asthma symptoms get progressively worse, it’s known as anexacerbation, or an asthma attack. Breathing becomes increasingly difficult because your airways are swollen and your bronchial tubes have narrowed. The symptoms of an exacerbation mayinclude: hyperventilation cough wheezing shortness of breath increased heart rate agitation confusion blue lips Although an exacerbation can end quickly without medication, you should contact your doctor when you experience one, because it can be life threatening. The longer an exacerbation lasts, the more it can affect your ability to breathe. That’s why exacerbations often require a trip to the emergency room. You can help prevent exacerbations by taking medications that help manage your asthma symptoms. Optum Now is operated by RVO Health.

108,Asthma,Prevention and management,"Because researchers have not yet found the exact cause, it’s challenging to know how to prevent asthma. But some strategies can help prevent asthma attacks,including: Avoiding triggers:Try to steer clear of chemicals, smells, or products that have caused breathing problems in the past. Reducing exposure to allergens:If you’ve identified allergens, such as dust and mold, that trigger asthma attacks, avoid them whenever possible. Getting allergy shots:Allergen immunotherapy is a type of treatment that may help change your immune system. With routine shots, your body may become less sensitive to triggers you encounter. Taking preventive medication:Your doctor may prescribe medication for you to take every day (in addition to the one you use in case of an asthma attack). Your doctor can help you create an asthma action plan so you know which treatments to use and when. In addition to using maintenance medications, you can take steps each day to improve your overall health and reduce your risk for asthma attacks. Theseinclude: Eating a nutritious diet:A healthy, balanced diet can help improve your overall health. Avoiding any foods you’re allergic to:Nutrient-rich foods are vital to helping reduce symptoms, but food allergies can trigger asthma symptoms. Making efforts to maintain a moderate weight:Asthma tends to be worse in people with overweight or obesity. If your doctor recommends that you lose weight, doing so may be beneficial for your heart, joints, and lungs. Quitting smoking, if you smoke:Cigarette smoke is an irritant that can trigger asthma and increase your risk of developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exercising regularly:Physical activity can trigger asthma attacks, but regular exercise may actually help reduce your risk of breathing problems. Finding healthy ways to manage stress:Stress can trigger asthma symptoms and make it more difficult to stop an asthma attack."
109,Asthma,When to see a doctor,"At the moment, there’s no cure for asthma. But there are many effective treatments that can decrease the symptoms. Lifestyle strategies and medications can also help improve your quality of life. If you haven’t received an asthma diagnosis but you’re experiencing symptoms such as wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath, it’s a good idea to make an appointment with a healthcare professional. You can find one in your area using theHealthline FindCare tool. If you receive a diagnosis of asthma, you should see your doctor at least once per year. If you have persistent symptoms even after trying some treatments, you may need to see your doctor more often. Call your doctor immediately if you: feel weak can’t perform daily activities have a wheeze or cough that won’t go away It’s important to learn about your condition and its symptoms. The more you know, the more proactive you can be in improving your lung function and how you feel. Talk with your doctor about: your type of asthma what triggers your symptoms what daily treatments are best for you your treatment plan for an asthma attack"
110,Asthma,Frequently asked questions,"Most inhalers are safe to use for up to 1 year after their expiration date. However, the medication will gradually lose its potency over time, and the manufacturer can no longer guarantee its effectiveness. While asthma attacks can be mild and short, a severe asthma attack is a serious medical condition and has the potential to be fatal. Seek medical attention if you or someone else experiences the following symptoms: breathlessness or wheezing that’s severe or quickly worsens shortness of breath that’s so bad you can speak in only short phrases the need to strain hard in order to breathe lips or fingernails that have turned gray or blue no symptom relief after using your rescue inhaler An anxiety attack and an asthma attack can sometimes feel very similar, as both can involve shortness of breath, insomnia, and fatigue. Watch for wheezing and coughing, which are clear symptoms of asthma. Choking sensations and muscle tension are more common in an anxiety attack."
111,Asthma,Takeaway,"Asthma is a condition that inflames your lungs and makes breathing difficult. It can affect both adults and children and has multiple forms and varying levels of severity. There are some medications available to treat asthma. The most common treatments are bronchodilators, which can be used in the short term to treat an asthma attack or in the long term to manage symptoms over time. Lifestyle strategies such as dietary changes, exercise, and stress management may also help reduce asthma flare-ups. A doctor can identify the type of asthma you have and help you find the best treatment and management options. Read this article in Spanish."
112,Autism,Overview,"ASD describes a group of neurodevelopmental conditions that become evident during early childhood. Certain genetic and environmental factors can contribute to its development. Autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism, is a broad term used to describe a group of neurodevelopmental conditions. Differences in communication and social interaction characterize these conditions. People with ASD often demonstrate restricted and repetitive interests or patterns of behavior."
113,Autism,What are the symptoms of autism?,"Symptoms of ASD typically become clearly evident during early childhood, between ages 12 and 24 months. However, symptoms may also appearearlierorlater. Early symptoms may include a marked delay inlanguageor social development. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR), used by clinicians to diagnose various psychiatric disorders, divides symptoms of ASD into two categories: problems with communication and social interaction restricted or repetitive patterns of behavior or activities To be diagnosed with autism, a person must experience symptoms in both of these categories. ASD can involve a range of issues withcommunication, many of which appear before age 5. Here’s a what this might look like over time: From birth:trouble maintaining eye contact By 9 months:not responding to their name; not displaying facial expressions reflective of their emotions (like surprise or anger) By 12 months: not engaging in basic interactive games; not calling a parent a special name, like “mama” or “dada”; using few or no gestures, like waving By 15 months:not sharing their interests with others (by showing someone a favorite toy, for example) By 18 months:not pointing or looking where others point; not pointing to show you something By 24 months:not noticing when others appear sad or hurt; not saying more than one of two words By 36 months:not noticing other children or joining them in play By 48 months:not engaging in “pretend play,” like like pretending to be a doctor or treacher By 60 months of age:not singing, acting, or dancing Additionally, autistic children might have trouble expressing their feelings or understanding those of others starting at 36 months. As they age, they might have difficulty talking orvery limited speaking skills. Other autistic children might develop language skills at an uneven pace. If a particular topic interests them, for example, they might develop a very strong vocabulary for talking about that one topic, but they might have difficulty communicating about other things. As autistic children begin talking, they might also talk in an unusual tone ranging from high-pitched and “sing-songy” to robotic or flat. They might also show signs ofhyperlexia, which involves reading beyond what’s expected of their age. Children on the autism spectrum might learn to read earlier than their neurotypical peers, sometimes as early as age 2. But they tend not to comprehend what they’re reading. While hyperlexia does not always accompany autism,a 2017 reviewsuggests anywhere from 6% to 20% of autistic children demonstrate early signs of hyperlexia, depending on how narrowly hyperlexia is defined. As they interact with others, autistic children might have difficulty sharing their emotions and interests with others or find it hard to maintain back-and-forth conversations. Nonverbal communication, like maintaining eye contact orbody language, might also remain difficult. These challenges with communication can persist throughout adulthood. In addition to the communication and social issues mentioned above, autism includes symptoms related to body movements and behaviors. These can include: repetitive movements, like rocking, flapping their arms, spinning, or running back and forth lining objects, like toys, up in strict order and getting upset when that order is disturbed attachment to strict routines, like those around bedtime or getting to school repeatingwords or phrases they hear someone say over and over again getting upset over minor changes focusing intently on parts of objects, like the wheel of a toy truck or the hair of a doll unusual reactions to sensory input, like sounds, smells, and tastes obsessive interests exceptional abilities, like musical talent or memory capabilities Some autistic people might experience additional symptoms, including: delayed movement, language, or cognitive skills seizures gastrointestinal symptoms, like constipation or diarrhea excessive worry or stress unusual levels of fear (either higher or lower than expected) hyperactive, inattentive, or impulsive behaviors unexpected emotional reactions unusual eating habits or preferences unusual sleep patterns self-stimulating behaviors, known as “stimming“"
114,Autism,What are the different types of autism?,"The DSM-5-TR currently recognizes five ASD subtypes or specifiers: with or without accompanying intellectual impairment with or without accompanying language impairment associated with a known medical or genetic condition or environmental factor associated with another neurodevelopmental, mental, or behavioral disorder withcatatonia Someone can receive a diagnosis of one or more specifiers. Before the DSM-5-TR, autistic people may have received a diagnosis of: autistic disorder Asperger’s syndrome pervasive development disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) childhood disintegrative disorder It’s important to note that a person who received one of these earlier diagnoses has not lost their diagnosis and will not need to be reevaluated."
115,Autism,What causes autism?,"The exact cause of ASD is unknown. Some suspected risk factors for ASD include: having an immediate family member who’s autistic certain genetic mutations fragile X syndromeand other genetic disorders being born toolder parents low birth weight metabolic imbalances exposure to heavy metals and environmental toxins a maternal history ofviral infections fetal exposure to the medications valproic acid or thalidomide (Thalomid) A controversial 1998 study proposed a linkbetween autism and themeasles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) vaccine. However, that study was debunked byother researchand eventuallyretractedin 2010."
116,Autism,What tests are used to diagnose autism?,"An ASD diagnosis involves: several screenings genetic tests evaluations TheAmerican Academy of Pediatrics(AAP) recommends that all children undergo ASD screening at ages 18 and 24 months. Screening can help identify ASD in children earlier than later. They may benefit from early diagnosis and support. TheModified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT)is a common screening tool many pediatric offices use. It’s important to note that screening is not a diagnosis. Children who screen positively for ASD do not necessarily have it. Additionally, screenings do not always identify every child who’s autistic. Your child’s physician may recommend a combination oftests for autism, including: DNA testing for genetic diseases behavioral evaluation visualandaudiotests to rule out any issues with vision and hearing that aren’t related to ASD occupational therapy screening developmental questionnaires A team of specialists typically makes the diagnosis. This team may include: child psychologists occupational therapists speech and language pathologists"
117,Autism,What treatments are available for autism?,"There areno “cures”for ASD. Rather, for some autistic people,supportive therapies and other considerationscan help them feel better or alleviate certain symptoms. Many approaches involve therapies such as: behavioral therapy play therapy occupational therapy physical therapy speech therapy Massages, weighted clothing andblankets, andmeditation techniquesmay also help some autistic people manage symptoms. However, results will vary. Some people may respond well to certain approaches, while others may not. Researchon alternative remedies is mixed, and some remedies can have negative health impacts. Before investing in any alternative therapy, parents and caregivers should weigh the research and financial costs against any possible benefits. When in doubt, talk with a healthcare professional."
118,Autism,The bottom line,"ASD is a complex condition with symptoms that can vary greatly from person to person. There’s no cure for autism, but several approaches can help with managing symptoms, building social skills, and improving quality of life. Lee este artículo en español aquí."
119,Autoimmune Disorders,Overview,"Autoimmune diseases are conditions in which your immune system mistakenly damages healthy cells in your body. Types include rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn’s disease, and some thyroid conditions. Your immune system has the job of protecting you from diseases and infections. When it senses these germs, it creates new cells to target foreign cells. Usually, your immune system can tell the difference between foreign cells and your cells. However, if you have an autoimmune disease, your immune system mistakes parts of your body, such as your joints or skin, as foreign. It releases proteins called autoantibodies that attack healthy cells. Below we provide an overview of some of the most common autoimmune diseases."
120,Autoimmune Disorders,What can cause autoimmune disease?,"Doctors don’t know exactly what causes the immune system to misfire. Yet some people are more likely to get an autoimmune disease than others. Some factors thatmay increaseyour risk of developing an autoimmune disease can include: Your sex:People assigned female at birth between the ages of 15 and 44 are more likely to get an autoimmune disease than people assigned male at birth. Your family history:You may be more likely to develop autoimmune diseases due to inherited genes, though environmental factors may also contribute. Environmental factors:Exposure to sunlight, mercury, chemicals like solvents or those used in agriculture, cigarette smoke, or certain bacterial and viral infections,including COVID-19, may increase your risk of autoimmune disease. Ethnicity:Some autoimmune diseases are more common in people in certain groups. For example, White people from Europe and the United States may be more likely to develop autoimmune muscle disease, while lupus tends to occur more in people who are African American, Hispanic, or Latino. Nutrition:Your diet and nutrients may impact the risk and severity of autoimmune disease. Other health conditions:Certain health conditions, including obesity and other autoimmune diseases, may make you more likely to develop an autoimmune disease."
121,Autoimmune Disorders,What are the common symptoms of an autoimmune disease?,"Different autoimmune diseases may have similar early symptoms. These can include: fatigue dizzinessor lightheadedness low grade fever muscle aches swelling trouble concentrating numbness and tinglingin your hands and feet hair loss skin rash With some autoimmune diseases, including psoriasis or rheumatoid arthritis (RA), symptoms may come and go. A period of symptoms is called a flare-up, and a period when the symptoms go away is called remission. Individual autoimmune diseases can also have their own unique symptoms depending on the body systems affected. For example, with type 1 diabetes, you may experience extreme thirst and weight loss. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) may cause bloating and diarrhea."
122,Autoimmune Disorders,What are the most common autoimmune diseases?,"Researchers have identified more than100 autoimmune diseases. Here are 10 more common ones. Your pancreas produces the hormone insulin, which helps regulate blood sugar levels. Intype 1 diabetes, the immune system destroys insulin-producing cells in your pancreas. High blood sugar from type 1 diabetes can damage the blood vessels and organs. InRA, your immune system attacks the joints, which can lead to swelling and stiffness in these areas. While RAmore commonlyaffects people as they get older, it can also start as early as your 30s. A related condition,juvenile idiopathic arthritis, can start in childhood. Skin cells grow and then shed when they’re no longer needed.Psoriasiscauses skin cells to multiply too quickly. The extra cells build up and form inflamed patches. On lighter skin tones, patches may appear red with silver-white scales of plaque. On darker skin tones, psoriasis may appear purplish or dark brown with gray scales. Up to30%of people with psoriasis also developpsoriatic arthritis. Multiple sclerosis (MS)damages the protective coating surrounding nerve cells (myelin sheath) in yourcentral nervous system. Damage to the myelin sheath slows the transmission speed of messages between your brain and spinal cord to and from the rest of your body. Different forms of MSprogress at different rates. Difficulties with walking are one of themost commonmobility issues with MS. IBDdescribes conditions that cause inflammation in the lining of the intestinal wall. Each type of IBD affects a different part of your gastrointestinal (GI) tract. There are 2 types: Crohn’s diseasecan inflame any part of your GI tract, from the mouth to the anus. Ulcerative colitisaffects the lining of the large intestine (colon) and rectum. Graves’ diseaseattacks the thyroid gland in your neck, causing it to produce too much of its hormones. Thyroid hormones control the body’s energy usage, known as metabolism. Having too much of these hormones revs up your body’s activities, causing symptoms like rapid heart rate and unintentionalweight loss. Some people with Graves’ disease may also experience symptoms affecting the skin (Graves’ dermopathy) or eyes (Graves’ ophthalmopathy). This condition attacks the glands that provide lubrication to your eyes and mouth. The hallmark symptoms of Sjögren disease are dry eyes and dry mouth, but it may also affect your joints or skin. Myasthenia gravisaffects nerve impulses that help the brain control muscles. When the communication from nerves to muscles is impaired, signals can’t direct the muscles to contract. The most common symptom is muscle weakness. It may worsen with activity and improve with rest. People withceliac diseasecan’t eat foods containing gluten, a protein found in wheat, rye, and other grain products. When gluten is in the small intestine, the immune system attacks this part of the GI tract and causes inflammation. People with celiac disease may experience digestive issues after consuming gluten. According to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, celiac disease affects about1%of the global population. Pernicious anemiamay happen when an autoimmune disorder causes your body to not produce enough of a substance called intrinsic factor. Having a deficiency in this substance reduces the amount ofvitamin B12your small intestine absorbs from food. It can cause alow red blood cell count. Without enough of this vitamin, you may develop anemia, and your body’s ability for proper DNA synthesis may be altered. This rare autoimmune disease typically occurs in peopleages 60 to 70and older."
123,Autoimmune Disorders,Frequently asked questions about autoimmune diseases,"Generally speaking, autoimmune disorders cannot be cured. They can, however, be controlled with medications and other treatments. Researchers are continuing to look for a cure, so the answer to this question may change in the coming years. There are over80 different types of autoimmune disordersand most are not fatal. People can expect to live full lives with no shortening of typical life expectancy. Some autoimmune disorders can have similar symptoms at early stages. These can include fatigue, dizziness or lightheadedness, low grade fever, muscle aches, and swelling. Many researchers recognizegiant cell myocarditis, a rare autoimmune condition that can lead to heart failure, as one of the most serious autoimmune diseases. It has a 1-year mortality rate of70%. Themost commonautoimmune diseases are psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis,connective tissue diseases, multiple sclerosis, autoimmune thyroid diseases such asHashimoto’s, celiac disease, and inflammatory bowel disease."
124,Autoimmune Disorders,Takeaway,"The symptoms of autoimmune diseases often overlap, complicating diagnoses. Blood tests that look for autoantibodies can help doctors diagnose these conditions. Treatments include medications to calm the overactive immune response and bring down inflammation in the body. TheHealthline FindCare toolcan provide options in your area if you need help finding a specialist. Read this article in Spanish."
125,Back Pain,Who experiences back pain?,"Lower back pain, sometimes called lumbago, is not a specific disease diagnosis. It’s a symptom of several different types of medical problems. It usually results from a problem with one or more parts of the lower back, such as: ligaments and muscles discs intervertebral discs nerves the bony structures that make up the spine, called vertebral bodies or vertebrae It can also be due to a problem with nearby organs, such as thekidneys. According to the American Association of Neurological Surgeons,75 to 85 percentof Americans will experience back pain in their lifetime. Of those, 50 percent will have more than one episode within a year. In 90 percent of all cases, the pain gets better without surgery. Talk with a doctor if you’re experiencing back pain."
126,Back Pain,Back pain treatment,"Many people will not need extensive treatment for back pain. Over-the-counterpain medicationsare often sufficient. In more severe cases, stronger treatments may be necessary, but they’re typically provided under close supervision from your doctor. The majority of back pain episodesare relievedby treatment withnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as: ibuprofen (Motrin, Advil) naproxen (Aleve) Analgesics, such asacetaminophen (Tylenol), are another category of pain relievers. They are also an option for back pain, though they don’t have the anti-inflammatory properties. Be careful with medications likeibuprofenif you have kidney problems orstomach ulcers. Never take more than the recommended dose of over-the-counter medications without a doctor’s recommendation, as even these medications may have severe side effects if taken incorrectly. Other medication optionsinclude: Topical products may be highly effective at reducing back pain. Many of these contain ingredients like ibuprofen and lidocaine and come in the form of: gels lotions creams patches sprays Muscle relaxantscan also be used for lower back pain, especially ifmuscle spasmsoccur alongside pain. These medications act on the central nervous system to reduce pain. Antidepressantsand other medications can sometimes be usedoff-labelfor the treatment of back pain. If your back pain is severe, your doctor may prescribeamitriptyline, a tricyclic antidepressant, because it focuses on different parts of the pain response. This antidepressant may also work better for nerve-related pain. Your doctor might alsorecommendcortisone steroid injections for certain causes of back pain. For example, a person with back pain that involves a nerve may get a cortisone steroid injection. Opioids are stronger pain medications that can be prescribed for more severe pain. These medications, such asoxycodone (OxyContin)and a combination of acetaminophen and hydrocodone (Vicodin), act on the brain cells and body to reduce pain. Opioids should be used with caution, however, due to a risk ofaddiction. Surgery is usually reserved for those with structural abnormalities that haven’t responded to nonsurgical treatment with medication and therapy. Surgery may be an option for people with: severe, constant pain with identifiable structural abnormalities nerve compressionthat causes muscles to become weak spinal cord compression that limits daily activities Alternative therapies thatmay helprelieve back pain include: acupuncture massage chiropractic adjustments cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) relaxation techniques Be sure to talk with your doctor before undergoing any alternative or complementary treatment. If you’re experiencing back pain,these lower back pain treatment options might be helpful. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
127,Back Pain,Back pain home remedies,"Many home remedies can be used with traditional back pain treatments. If you have questions about these, talk with your doctor. Ice packsmay relieve discomfort andhelplessen inflammation in short-term phases of back pain.Note:Don’t apply the ice directly to your skin. Wrap it in a thin towel or gauze to prevent damage to your skin. Warm compressesmay also relieve pain when inflammation has gone down. Consider switching between heat and cold. Exercises to improve posture and strengthen the back and abdominal muscles — called the core muscles — are a treatment option that should be strongly considered. This treatment often involves: improving posture using proper lifting techniques strengthening core muscles stretching muscles to improve flexibility Aphysical therapistcan teach you how to perform these types of exercises at home. Researchsuggests thatessential oilorointmentsmade with capsaicin may help decrease pain. Capsaicin is the ingredient in peppers that makes them hot. These ingredients may desensitize the nerves in the affected area and decrease the pain you feel. Home remedies may be highly effective at reducing back pain.Learn more about how to use them and how they work."
128,Back Pain,Back pain causes,"Themost commoncauses of lower back pain are strain and problems with back structures. Strained musclesoften cause back pain. Strain commonly occurs with incorrect lifting of heavy objects and sudden awkward movements. Strain can also result from overactivity. An example is the sore feeling and stiffness that occurs after a few hours of yard work or playing a sport. Vertebrae are the interlocking bones stacked on top of one another that make up the spine. Discs are areas of tissue that cushion the spaces between each vertebra. Disc injuries are afairly commoncause of back pain. Sometimes these discs can bulge, herniate, or rupture. Nerves can get compressed when this happens. Herniated discscan be very painful. Abulging discpressing on the nerve that travels from your back and down your leg can cause sciatica or irritation of the sciatic nerve.Sciaticacan be experienced in your leg as: pain tingling numbness Spinal osteoarthritisis also a potential cause of back pain. It’s caused by damage and deterioration in the cartilage of joints in your lower back. Over time, this condition can lead to narrowing of the spinal column, orspinal stenosis. Loss of bone density and thinning of the bone, calledosteoporosis, can lead to small fractures in your vertebrae. These fractures can cause serious pain and are referred to ascompression fractures. There are many other potential causes of back pain, but most are rare. Be sure to see a doctor if you experience regular back pain that does not go away. After ruling out the more common causes of back pain, your doctor will perform tests to determine if you have a rarer cause. These caninclude: one of the vertebrae moving out of place and onto a nearby vertebra, called degenerativespondylolisthesis loss of nerve function at the lower spinal cord, calledcauda equina syndrome(a medical emergency) fungal or bacterial infection of the spine, such asStaphylococcus,E. coli, ortuberculosis cancer ornoncancerous (benign) tumorin the spine kidney infectionorkidney stones"
129,Back Pain,Back pain symptoms,"Back pain can have many symptoms, including: a dull, aching sensation in the lower back a stabbing or shooting pain that can radiate down the leg to the foot an inability to stand up straight without pain a decreased range of motion and reduced ability to flex the back The symptoms of back pain, if due to strain or misuse, are usually short lived but can last for days or weeks. Back pain is chronic when symptoms have been present forlonger than3 months. See your doctor if back pain doesn’t improve within 2 weeks of developing. There are times when back pain can be a symptom of a serious medical problem. Symptoms that can indicate a more serious medical problem are: loss ofbowelorbladder control numbness, tingling, or weakness in one or both legs back pain after trauma (injury), such as a fall or a blow to the back intense, constant pain that gets worse at night unexplained weight loss pain associated with a throbbing sensation in the abdomen fever Let your doctor know if you have any of these symptoms."
130,Back Pain,Back pain diagnosis,"A physical exam istypicallyall that’s needed to diagnose back pain. During the physical exam, your doctor may test your: ability to stand and walk spine’s range of motion reflexes leg strength ability to detect sensations in your legs If a serious condition is suspected, your doctor might order other tests,including: blood andurine teststo check for underlying conditions X-raysof the spine to show alignment of your bones and check for breaks CT scanorMRI scanto assess your discs, muscles, ligaments, nerves, and blood vessels bone scanto look for abnormalities in the bone tissue electromyography (EMG)to test nerve signals"
131,Back Pain,How to prevent back pain,"These tips can help ease back pain when it happens. They can also help you prevent back pain in the first place. Heavy briefcases, laptop bags, suitcases, and purses can add unnecessary stress and strain to your neck and spine. Try to reduce what you need to carry, and use bags that distribute the weight more evenly, such as a backpack. If you can, use a bag with wheels to keep weight off your back entirely.

However, you should be sure to talk with your doctor about what you’re experiencing, in case the pain may be part of a bigger problem. Here are afew reasonswhy you may be experiencing back pain during pregnancy: As your baby grows, the center of your body’s “gravity” moves outward. Your spine and back arch to make up for the change in balance. This put extra stress on the lower lumbar spine. Weight gaincan be a healthy part of pregnancy, but even the little bit you’re likely to gain during those 9 months can put more stress on your back and core muscles. As your body prepares to deliver the baby, it releaseshormonesthat loosen the ligaments that stabilize your pelvis and lumbar spine.

139,Bipolar Disorder,Overview,"Bipolar disorder is a mental health condition marked by large changes in mood from mania to depression. The National Institute of Mental Health says that 2.8% of U.S. adults — or about 5 million people — have a bipolar disorder diagnosis. The condition used to be known as manic depression and bipolar disease. Treatment can help you manage mood episodes and cope with the symptoms they cause. Your care team might involve your primary doctor, a psychiatrist who manages your medications, and a therapist or counselor who provides talk therapy. Bipolar disorder isn’t a rare condition. In fact, the National Institute of Mental Health says that2.8%of U.S. adults — or about 5 million people — have a bipolar disorder diagnosis. The condition used to be known as manic depression and bipolar disease."
140,Bipolar Disorder,Types of bipolar disorder,"There are three main types of bipolar disorder: bipolar I, bipolar II, and cyclothymia. Your healthcare professional can explain more about what kind of bipolar disorder you have when discussing your diagnosis. Some people experience distinct mood symptoms that resemble but don’t align with these three types. This may be diagnosed as “other specified bipolar and related disorders” or “unspecified bipolar and related disorders.” Bipolar Iis defined by the appearance of at least onemanicepisode. You may experience hypomanic episodes, which are less severe than manic episodes, or majordepressiveperiods before and after the manic episode. You may also go through a long period of stable mood before experiencing either mania or depression. People with bipolar II experience one major depressive episode that lasts at least 2 weeks. They also have at least 1 hypomanic episode that lasts about 4 days. According to a2017 review, this type of bipolar disorder may be more common in people assigned female at birth. People withcyclothymiaexperience some symptoms ofhypomaniaand depression, but not enough to characterize an episode of hypomania ordepression. These episodes also involve symptoms that are shorter and less severe than the episodes associated with bipolar I or bipolar II disorder. Most people with this condition experienceno mood symptomsfor1 to 2 monthsat a time."
141,Bipolar Disorder,Bipolar disorder symptoms,"Mania, hypomania, and depression are the main features of bipolar disorder. Different types of bipolar disorder involve different combinations of these symptoms. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5thedition, text revision (DSM-5-TR), a diagnosis of bipolar I disorder requires: at least one episode of mania that lasts at least 1 week symptoms that affect daily function symptoms that don’t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use You could also experience symptoms of both mania and depression (known asmixed features). These symptoms can have more impact on your life. While you don’t need to experience episodes of hypomania or depression to receive a bipolar I diagnosis, many people with bipolar I do report these symptoms. A diagnosis of bipolar II requires: at least one episode of hypomania that lasts 4 days or longer and involves 3 or more symptoms of hypomania hypomania-related changes in mood and usual function that others can notice, though these may not necessarily affect your daily life at least one episode of major depression that lasts 2 weeks or longer at least one episode of major depression involving five or more key depression symptoms that have a significant impact on your day-to-day life symptoms that don’t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use Bipolar II can also involve symptoms of psychosis, but only during an episode of depression. You could also experience mixed mood episodes, which means you’ll have symptoms of depression and hypomania simultaneously. With bipolar II, though, you won’t experience mania. If you have a manic episode, you’ll receive a diagnosis of bipolar I. A diagnosis of cyclothymia requires: periods of hypomanic symptoms and periods of depression symptoms, off and on, over2 years or longer(1 yearfor children and adolescents) symptoms that never meet the full criteria for an episode of hypomania or depression symptoms that are present for at least half of the 2 years and never absent for longer than 2 months at a time symptoms that don’t relate to another medical or mental health condition or substance use symptoms that cause significant distress and affect daily life Fluctuating mood symptoms characterize cyclothymia. These symptoms may be less severe than those of bipolar I or II. Still, they tend to last longer, so you’ll generally have less time when you experience no symptoms. Hypomania may not have a big impact on your daily life. Depression, on the other hand, often leads to more serious distress and affects day-to-day function, even if your symptoms don’t qualify for a major depressive episode. If you do experience enough symptoms to meet the criteria for a hypomanic or depressive episode, your diagnosis will likely change to another type of bipolar disorder or major depression."
142,Bipolar Disorder,Understanding bipolar-related episodes of mania and hypomania,"An episode of mania often involves an emotional high. You might feel excited, impulsive, euphoric, and full of energy. You might also feel jumpy or notice your thoughts seem to race. Some people also experiencehallucinations and other symptoms of psychosis. Manic episodes can involve behavior that’s more impulsive than usual, often because you feel invincible or untouchable. Commonly cited examples of this kind of behavior include: having partner sexwithout a condomor other barrier method misusing alcohol and drugs going on spending sprees But impulsiveness can also show up in plenty of other ways. Maybe you: quit your job abruptly take off on a road trip by yourself without telling anyone make a big investment on a whim drive much faster than usual, well above the speed limit participate in extreme sports you wouldn’t ordinarily consider While there are many reasons why a person might engage in these behaviors, the key to mania is that these are not things you would choose to engage in periods of stable mood. Hypomania involves many of the same symptoms, though they’re less severe. Unlike mania, hypomania often doesn’t lead to consequences at work, school, or in your relationships. Episodes of hypomania don’t involvepsychosis. They typically won’t last as long as episodes of mania or require inpatient care. With hypomania, you might feel very productive and energized, but you may not notice other changes in your mood. People who don’t know you well may not, either. Those closest to you, however, will usually pick up on your shifting mood and energy levels."
143,Bipolar Disorder,Understanding bipolar-related episodes of major depression,"A “down” change in mood can leave you feeling lethargic, unmotivated, and sad. Bipolar-relatedepisodes of major depressioninvolve at least five of these symptoms: a lasting low mood marked by deep sadness,hopelessness, or feelings of emptiness loss of energy a sense of feeling slower than usual or persistent restlessness lack of interest in activities you once enjoyed periods oftoo little or too much sleep a sense ofguiltor worthlessness trouble concentrating, focusing, and making decisions thoughts of death, dying, or suicide changes in appetite or weight Not everyone with bipolar disorder experiences major depressive episodes, though many people do. Depending on your type of bipolar disorder, you might experience only a few symptoms of depression but not the full five needed to diagnose a major episode. It’s also worth noting that sometimes, but not always, the euphoria of mania can feel enjoyable. Once you get treatment for mania, the symptom-free mood you experience might feel more like a “down” shift or a period of depression than a more typical mood state. While bipolar disorder can cause a depressed mood, bipolar disorder and depression have one major difference: With bipolar disorder, you might have “up” and “down” mood states. With depression, though, your mood and emotions might remain “down” until you get treatment."
144,Bipolar Disorder,How bipolar disorder affects people of different sexes,"Most research suggests that bipolar disorder is diagnosed atroughly the samerate across male and female populations. People assigned female at birthtend to receivediagnoses later in life, often in their 20s or 30s. Sometimes, they might first notice symptoms during pregnancy or after childbirth. They’re also more likely to be diagnosed with bipolar II than bipolar I. People assigned female at birth living with bipolar disordertend to experience: milder episodes of mania more depressive episodes than manic episodes rapid cycling, or four or more episodes of mania and depression in 1 year more co-occurring conditions People assigned female at birth may also experience relapse more often, partly due to hormone changes related to menstruation,pregnancy, andmenopause. In terms of bipolar disorder, relapse means having a mood episode after not having one for some time. People assigned male at birth may: get a diagnosis earlier in life experience less frequent but more severe episodes, especially manic episodes be more likely to also have asubstance use disorder show moreaggressionduring episodes of mania"
145,Bipolar Disorder,How bipolar disorder affects historically marginalized groups,"Researchshows that people from historically marginalized groups, particularly those of African ancestry, are frequently misdiagnosed with other conditions likeschizophrenia, especially if they exhibit symptoms of psychosis. While the symptoms of bipolar disorder can vary somewhat from person to person and can depend on the type, there are clear criteria for diagnosis. Research also suggests that50% to 75%of people living with bipolar disorder will experience some symptoms of psychosis, but this is stable across all racial and ethnic groups. Both these factors suggest that bias may play a role in this frequent misdiagnosis."
146,Bipolar Disorder,How bipolar disorder affects children and teens,"Diagnosing bipolar disorder in children is controversial, largely because children don’t always display the same symptoms as adults. Many bipolar disorder symptoms that occur in children also overlap with symptoms of other common conditions, such asattention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). However, in the last few decades, doctors and mental health professionals have come to recognize the condition in children. A diagnosis can help children get treatment, but reaching a diagnosis may take many weeks or months. It may be worth seeking care from a professional who specializes in treating children with mental health conditions. Like adults, children with bipolar disorder experience extreme mood shifts. Theycan appearvery happy and show signs of excitable behavior or seem very tearful, low, and irritable. All children experience mood changes, but bipolar disorder causes distinct and noticeable mood symptoms. Bipolar-related mood changes are usually more extreme than a child’s typical change in mood. Shifting hormones, plus the life changes that naturally happen withpuberty, can make teens seem extremely emotional from time to time. Yet drastic or rapidly fluctuating changes in mood may suggest a more serious condition, such as bipolar disorder, rather thantypical teenage development. Diagnosis is most common during the late teen and early adult years. Remember that many of these potential signs, like experimenting with substances and thinking about sex, aren’t uncommon teenage behaviors. But if they seem part of a larger pattern of shifting moods or start to affect their day-to-day life, they could be a sign of bipolar disorder or another condition."
147,Bipolar Disorder,Bipolar disorder treatment and management,"Several treatmentscan help you manage bipolar disorder symptoms. These include medications, counseling, and lifestyle measures. Somenatural remediescan also have benefits. Recommendedmedicationsmay include: mood stabilizers, such aslithium(Lithobid) antipsychotics, such asolanzapine(Zyprexa) antidepressant-antipsychotics, such as fluoxetine-olanzapine (Symbyax) benzodiazepines, a type of anti-anxiety medication used for short-term treatment Cognitive behavioral therapyis a type of talk therapy that helps you identify and address unhelpful thoughts and change unwanted patterns of behavior. Therapy offers a safer space to discuss ways to manage your symptoms. A therapist can also offer support with: understanding thought patterns reframingdistressing emotions learning and practicing more helpfulcoping strategies Psychoeducation is a therapeutic approach centered around helping you learn about a condition and its treatment. This knowledge can go a long way toward helping you and the supportive people in your life recognize early mood symptoms and manage them more effectively. Interpersonal and social rhythm therapy focuses on regulating daily habits, such as sleeping, eating, and exercising. Balancing these everyday basics could lead to fewer mood episodes and less severe symptoms. Interested in online therapy? Our roundup of thebest teletherapy optionscan help you find the right fit. Some natural remedies might also help with symptom management. You’ll always want to check with your doctor or psychiatrist before trying these remedies, though. In some cases, they could interfere with any medications you’re taking. The following herbs and supplements may help stabilize your mood and reduce symptoms of bipolar disorder when combined with medication and therapy: Omega-3:Some2016 researchsuggests that taking an omega-3 supplement may help with symptoms of bipolar I. However, a2021 studyfound weak support for using the supplement to treat depression symptoms in bipolar disorder. Rhodiola rosea:A2013 reviewsuggeststhis plantmay help with moderate depression, so it could help treat depression associated with bipolar disorder, but this, too, has not been substantiated with newer research. S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe):SAMe is an amino acid supplement that mayhelp easesymptoms of major depression and other mood disorders. However, itcan inducemania and may interact with other medications. You should consult with a doctor before trying SAMe or any other herbal or natural remedies to help you manage your bipolar symptoms. Some studies suggest that lifestyle measures can helpreduce the severityof your symptoms. These can include the following: eating a balanced diet getting at least 150 minutes of exercise a week managing your weight getting weekly counseling or therapy That said, the improvements reported by many of these studies werenot significant, indicating that lifestyle interventions alone may not be enough to manage the condition. They may work better when combined with other treatments."
148,Bipolar Disorder,Potential causes and risk factors for bipolar disorder,"Bipolar disorder is a fairly common mental health condition, but experts have yet to determine why some people develop it Some potential causes include: If a biological parent or sibling has bipolar disorder, you’re more likely to develop the condition. The risk of developing bipolar disorder is10% to 25%if one of your parents has the condition. Keep in mind, though, that most people who have a history of bipolar disorder in their family history don’t develop it. Your brain structure may affect your risk of developing bipolar disorder. Irregularities in brain chemistry, or the structure or functions of your brain, may increase this risk. It’s not just what’s in your body that can affect your chances of developing bipolar disorder. Outside factors can also play a part. These might include: extreme stress traumatic experiences physical illness It depends. Once you begin to experience mood episodes, you cantake steps to help reduce the severity of those episodes and lower your chances of experiencing additional mood episodes. But you can’t always prevent mood episodes entirely or keep the condition from developing in the first place. Future research may reveal more about the specific causes of bipolar disorder and give researchers more insight into potential ways of preventing the condition."
149,Bipolar Disorder,Common co-occurring conditions with bipolar disorder,"Some people living with bipolar disorder also have other mental health conditions. A2019 research reviewsuggests that anxiety disorders are among the most common. Other conditions that might occur alongside bipolar disorder include: substance use disorders eating disorders specific phobias ADHD Symptoms of these conditions might show up more severely depending on your mood state. Anxiety, for example, tends to happen more commonly with depression, while substance use disorders might be more likely with mania. If you have bipolar disorder, you may also have a higher chance of developing certain medical conditions, including: migraine heart disease diabetes thyroid disorders"
150,Bipolar Disorder,Ways to cope and find support when living with bipolar disorder,"If you’ve noticed symptoms of bipolar disorder, a good first step involves reaching out to a doctor or therapist as soon as possible. Similarly, if a friend or loved one has symptoms, consider encouraging them to connect with a therapist as soon as possible. It never hurts to remind them that you understand and support them. Treatment can help you manage mood episodes and cope with the symptoms they cause. Creating a care team can help you get the most out of treatment. Your team might involve: your primary doctor a psychiatrist who manages your medications a therapist or counselor who provides talk therapy other professionals or specialists, such as a sleep specialist, acupuncturist, or massage therapist abipolar disorder support groupor community of other people also living with bipolar disorder You may need to try a few treatments before you find one that leads to improvement. Some medications work well for some people but not others. In a similar vein, some people find CBT very helpful, while others may see little improvement. It’s always best to be open with your care team about what works and what doesn’t. If something doesn’t help or makes you feel even worse, don’t hold back from letting them know. Your mental health matters, and your care team should always support you in finding the most helpful approach. A little self-compassion can go a long way, too.

152,Birth Defects,Overview,"About birth defects A birth defect is a problem that occurs when a baby is developing in utero (in the womb). Approximately1 out of every 33 babiesin the United States is born with a birth defect. Birth defects can be minor or severe. They may affect appearance, organ function, and physical and mental development. Most birth defects are present within the first three months of pregnancy, when the organs are still forming. Some birth defects are harmless. Others require long-term medical treatment. Severe birth defects are the leading cause of infant death in the United States, accounting for20 percentof deaths."
153,Birth Defects,What causes birth defects?,"Birth defects can be a result of: genetics lifestyle choices and behaviors exposure to certain medications and chemicals infections during pregnancy a combination of these factors However, the exact causes of certain birth defects are often unknown. The mother or father may pass on genetic abnormalities to their baby. Genetic abnormalities occur when a gene becomes flawed due to a mutation, or change. In some cases, a gene or part of a gene might be missing. These defects happen at conception and often can’t be prevented. A particular defect may be present throughout the family history of one or both parents. The causes of some birth defects can be difficult or impossible to identify. However, certain behaviors greatly increase the risk of birth defects. These include smoking, using illegal drugs, and drinking alcohol while pregnant. Other factors, such as exposure to toxic chemicals or viruses, also increase risk."
154,Birth Defects,What are the risk factors for birth defects?,"All pregnant women have some risk of delivering a child with a birth defect. Risk increases under any of the following conditions: family history of birth defects or other genetic disorders drug use, alcohol consumption, or smoking during pregnancy maternal age of 35 years or older inadequate prenatal care untreated viral or bacterial infections, including sexually transmitted infections use of certain high-risk medications, such as isotretinoin and lithium Women with pre-existing medical conditions, such asdiabetes, are also at a higher risk of having a child with a birth defect."
155,Birth Defects,Common birth defects,"Birth defects are typically classified as structural or functional and developmental. Structural defects are when a specific body part is missing or malformed. The most common structural defects are: heart defects cleft lip or palate, when there’s an opening or split in the lip or roof of the mouth spina bifida, when the spinal cord doesn’t develop properly clubfoot, when the foot points inward instead of forward Functional or developmental birth defects cause a body part or system not to work properly. These often cause disabilities of intelligence or development. Functional or developmental birth defects include metabolic defects, sensory problems, and nervous system problems. Metabolic defects cause problems with the baby’s body chemistry. The most common types of functional or developmental birth defects include: Down syndrome, which causes delay in physical and mental development sickle cell disease, which occurs when the red blood cells become misshapen cystic fibrosis, which damages the lungs and digestive system Some children face physical problems associated with specific birth defects. However, many children show no visible abnormalities. Defects can sometimes go undetected for months or even years after the child is born."
156,Birth Defects,How are birth defects diagnosed?,"Many types of birth defects can be diagnosed during pregnancy. A healthcare professional can useprenatal ultrasoundsto help them diagnose certain birth defects in utero. More in-depth screening options, such as blood tests andamniocentesis(taking a sample of the amniotic fluid), may also be done. These tests are usually offered to women who have higher-risk pregnancies due to family history, advanced maternal age, or other known factors. Prenatal tests can help determine whether the mother has an infection or other condition that’s harmful to the baby. A physical examination and hearing test may also help the doctor diagnose birth defects after the baby is born. A blood test called the newborn screen can help doctors diagnose some birth defects shortly after birth, before symptoms occur. It’s important to know that prenatal screening doesn’t always find defects when they’re present. A screening test can also falsely identify defects. However, most birth defects can be diagnosed with certainty after birth."
157,Birth Defects,How are birth defects treated?,"Treatment options vary depending on the condition and level of severity. Some birth defects can be corrected before birth or shortly after. Other defects, however, may affect a child for the rest of their life. Mild defects can be stressful, but they don’t typically affect overall quality of life. Severe birth defects, such ascerebral palsyor spina bifida, can cause long-term disability or even death. Speak with your doctor about the appropriate treatment for your child’s condition. Medications:Medications may be used to treat some birth defects or to lower the risk of complications from certain defects. In some cases, medication may be prescribed to the mother to help correct an abnormality before birth. Surgeries:Surgery can fix certain defects or ease harmful symptoms. Some people with physical birth defects, such as cleft lip, may undergo plastic surgery for either health or cosmetic benefits. Many babies with heart defects will need surgery, as well. Home care:Parents may be instructed to follow specific instructions for feeding, bathing, and monitoring an infant with a birth defect."
158,Birth Defects,How can birth defects be prevented?,"Many birth defects can’t be prevented, but there are some ways to lower the risk of having a baby with a birth defect. Women who plan to become pregnant should start taking folic acid supplements before conception. These supplements should also be taken throughout the pregnancy. Folic acid can help prevent defects of the spine and brain.Prenatal vitaminsare also recommended during pregnancy. Women should avoid alcohol, drugs, and tobacco during and after pregnancy. They should also use caution when taking certain medications. Some medications that are normally safe can cause serious birth defects when taken by a pregnant woman. Make sure to tell your doctor about any medications you may be taking, including over-the-counter drugs and supplements. Most vaccines are safe during pregnancy. In fact, some vaccines can help prevent birth defects. There is a theoretical risk of harm to a developing fetus with some live-virus vaccines, so these kinds should not be given during pregnancy. You should ask your doctor which vaccines are necessary and safe. Maintaining a healthy weight also helps reduce the risk of complications during pregnancy. Women with pre-existing conditions, such as diabetes, should take special care to manage their health. It’s extremely important to attend regular prenatal appointments. If your pregnancy is considered high risk, your doctor can do additional prenatal screening to identify defects. Depending on the type of defect, your doctor may be able to treat it before the baby is born. A genetic counselor can advise couples with family histories of a defect or other risks factors for birth defects. A counselor may be helpful when you’re thinking about having children or already expecting. Genetic counselors can determine the likelihood that your baby will be born with defects by evaluating family history and medical records. They may also order tests to analyze the genes of the mother, father, and baby."

162,Blood Cell Disorders,Red blood cell disorders,"Red blood cell disorders affect the body’s red blood cells. These blood cells carry oxygen from your lungs to the rest of your body. There are various disorders that can affect both children and adults. Anemia is one type of red blood cell disorder, and there aremany types: Iron deficiency anemia:This occurs when your body does not have enough iron. You may feel tired and short of breath because your red blood cells are not carrying enough oxygen to your lungs.Iron supplementationusually resolvesiron deficiency anemia. Pernicious anemia:Pernicious anemiais an autoimmune condition in which your body is unable to absorb sufficient amounts ofvitamin B12. This results in a low number of red blood cells. It is called “pernicious,” meaning dangerous, because it used to be untreatable and often fatal. Now, B12 injections usually cure this type of anemia. Aplastic anemia:This is a rare but serious condition in which your bone marrow stops making enough new blood cells.Aplastic anemiacan occur suddenly or slowly, and at any age. It can leave you feeling tired and unable to fight off infections or uncontrolled bleeding. Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AHA):AHAcauses your immune system to destroy your red blood cells faster than your body can replace them, resulting in too few red blood cells. Sickle cell anemia (SCA):SCAis a type of anemia that draws its name from the unusual sickle shape of the affected red blood cells. Due to a genetic mutation, these red blood cells contain abnormal hemoglobin molecules, which leave them rigid and curved. The sickle-shaped red blood cells can’t carry as much oxygen to your tissues as regular red blood cells can. They may also become stuck in the blood vessels, blocking blood flow to your organs. Thalassemiais a group of inherited blood disorders. These disorders are caused by genetic mutations that prevent the regular production of hemoglobin. When red blood cells do not have enough hemoglobin, oxygen doesn’t get to all parts of the body. Organs then do not function properly. These disorderscan cause: bone irregularities enlarged spleen heart problems growth and developmental delaysin children jaundice Polycythemia verais a blood cancer caused by a gene mutation. If you have polycythemia, your bone marrow makes too many red blood cells. This causes your blood to thicken and flow more slowly, putting youat riskforblood clotsthat can causeheart attacksorstrokes. There is no known cure, but several treatments can help manage this condition. Treatment involves phlebotomy, or removing blood from your veins, and medication."
163,Blood Cell Disorders,White blood cell disorders,"White blood cells (leukocytes) help defend the body against infection and foreign substances. White blood cell disorders can affect your body’s immune response and its ability to fight infection. These disorders can affect both adults and children. Lymphomais a blood cancer that occurs in the body’s lymphatic system. Your white blood cells change and grow out of control.Hodgkin’s lymphomaandnon-Hodgkin’s lymphomaare thetwo major typesof lymphoma. Leukemiais a blood cancer in which malignant white blood cells multiply inside your body’s bone marrow. Leukemia may be eitheracute or chronic. Chronic leukemia advances more slowly. MDSaffects the white blood cells and their precursors in your bone marrow. The body produces too many immature cells, called blasts. The blasts multiply and crowd out the mature and healthy cells. MDS may progress either slowly or quite fast. Itsometimes leads toleukemia. Plasma cell myelomais arareblood cancer that develops in the plasma cells in the bone marrow. Plasma cells are a type of white blood cell in your body that makes antibodies. These cells are very important to your body’s ability to ward off infection and disease. Malignant plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow and form tumors called plasmacytomas, generally in bones such as the spine, hips, or ribs. The abnormal plasma cells produce abnormal antibodies called monoclonal (M) proteins. These proteins build up in the bone marrow, crowding out the healthy proteins. This can lead to thickened blood and kidney damage. The cause of plasma cell myeloma is unknown."
164,Blood Cell Disorders,Platelet disorders,"Blood platelets are the first responders when you have a cut or other injury. They gather at the site of the injury, creating a temporary plug to stop blood loss. If you have a platelet disorder, your blood hasone of threeirregularities: Not enough platelets — thrombocytopenia:Having too few platelets is dangerous because even a small injury can cause serious blood loss. Too many platelets — thrombocytosis:If you have too many platelets in your blood, blood clots can form and block a major artery, causing a stroke or heart attack. Platelets that don’t clot correctly:Sometimes, deformed platelets can’t stick to other blood cells or the walls of your blood vessels, and so can’t clot properly. This can also lead to a dangerous loss of blood."
165,Blood Cell Disorders,Blood clotting disorders,"Blood clotting relies not only on blood cells and platelets but also on other factors and proteins in the blood that help activate the chain of events leading to clot formation. Problems with these factors can lead to blood clot formation or excessive bleeding. Von Willebrand diseaseis themost commoninheritedbleeding disorder. It is caused by a deficiency of a protein that helps your blood clot, called von Willebrand factor. Symptoms can include: frequent nosebleeds that are hard to stop constant bruising heavy menstrual bleeding longer than usual bleeding after injury Treatment can include injections or factor replacement therapy. Hemophiliais probably the most well-known blood clotting disorder, and italmost alwaysoccurs in males. The most serious complication of hemophilia is excessive and prolonged bleeding. This bleeding can be eitherinsideor outside your body, and sometimes the bleeding can start with no apparent cause. Treatment involves a hormone called desmopressin for mild type A, which can promote the release of more of the reduced clotting factor, and blood (plasma) infusions for types B and C. Primary thrombocythemiais arare disorderthat can lead to increased blood clotting. This puts you at higher risk for stroke or heart attack. The disorder occurs when your bone marrow produces too many platelets. Certain drugs and medical conditions can also affect the functioning of platelets. Be sure to coordinate all your medications with your doctor, even over-the-counter supplements or vitamins. TheCanadian Hemophilia Society (CHS)warns that the following common drugs may affect platelets, especially if taken long-term: aspirin nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory (NSAIDs) some antibiotics heart drugs blood thinners antidepressants anesthetics antihistamines"
166,Blood Cell Disorders,How are blood cell disorders diagnosed?,"Your doctor may order several tests, including acomplete blood count (CBC), to identify how many of each type of blood cell you have. Your doctor may also order abone marrow biopsyto check whether any abnormal cells are developing in your marrow. This will involve removing a small amount of bone marrow for testing."
167,Blood Cell Disorders,What are the treatment options for blood cell disorders?,"Your treatment plan depends on the cause of your illness, age, and overall health status. Your doctor may use a combination of treatments to help treat your blood cell disorder. Some pharmacotherapy options include vitamins and minerals for certain types of anemia, and prescription medications and chemotherapy for blood cancers. Bone marrow transplantsmay repair or replace damaged marrow. These involve transferring stem cells, usually from a donor, to your body to help your bone marrow begin producing typical blood cells. A blood transfusion is another option to help you replace lost or damaged blood cells. During a blood transfusion, you receive an infusion of healthy blood from a donor. Both procedures require specific criteria to succeed. Bone marrow donors must match or be as close as possible to your genetic profile.Blood transfusionsrequire a donor with a compatible blood type. For some genetic disorders, like hemophilia,gene therapycan be used to help treat the condition. It’s usually given an injection into a vein, where the gene is carried into the body’s cells. This affects the levels of the missing factor that is causing excessive bleeding."
168,Blood Cell Disorders,What is the long-term outlook for blood cell disorders?,"The variety of blood cell disorders means that your experience of living with one of these conditions may vary greatly from someone else’s. Early diagnosis and treatment are the best ways to ensure you live a healthy and full life with a blood cell disorder. Different side effects of treatments vary depending on the person. Research your options, and speak with your doctor to find the right treatment for you. Finding a support group orcounselorto help you manage any emotional stress about having a blood cell disorder is also helpful. TheAmerican Society of Hematologylists organizations for specific blood cell disorders that may also offer related support groups."
169,Blood Cell Disorders,Takeaway,"Blood cell disorders can happen to anyone, and understanding the specifics of the different kinds of conditions will help you receive the appropriate treatment. It’s important to keep aware of your symptoms, get regular check-ups, and follow your doctor’s medical advice."
170,Brain Disorders,Overview,"Different problems with the brain can have various causes, such as illness, genetics, or injury. Each comes with different risks, diagnoses, and treatments."
171,Brain Disorders,What are brain disorders?,"Your brain is your body’s control center. It’s part of the nervous system, which also includes the spinal cord and a large network of nerves and neurons. Together, the nervous system controls everything from your senses to the muscles throughout your body. When your brain is damaged, it can affect many different things, including your memory, your sensation, and even your personality. Brain disorders include any conditions or disabilities that affect your brain. This includes conditions that are caused by: illness genetics traumatic injury This is a broad category of disorders, which vary greatly in symptoms and severity. Keep reading to learn about some of the largest categories of brain disorders."
172,Brain Disorders,What are the different types of brain disorders?,"Brain injuries are often caused by blunt trauma. Trauma can damage your brain tissue, neurons, and nerves. This damage affects your brain’s ability to communicate with the rest of your body. Examples ofbrain injuriesinclude: hematomas blood clots contusions, or bruising of brain tissue cerebral edema, or swelling inside the skull concussions strokes Examples of the symptoms of a brain injuryinclude: vomiting nausea speech difficulty bleeding from the ear numbness headaches paralysis memory loss problems with concentration Later, you may develop: high blood pressure a low heart rate pupil dilation irregular breathing Depending on the type of injury you have, treatment may include: medication rehabilitation brain surgery Many people with severe brain injuries need surgery to remove or repair damaged tissue or to relieve pressure. People with minor brain injuries may not need any treatment beyond pain medication. Most people with brain injuries need rehabilitation. This can include: physical therapy speech and language therapy psychiatric services Sometimes, tumors form in the brain and can be very dangerous. These are called primarybrain tumors. In other cases, cancer somewhere else in your body spreads to your brain. These are called secondary or metastatic brain tumors. Brain tumors can be either malignant (cancerous) or benign (noncancerous). Doctors classify brain tumors as grades 1, 2, 3, or 4. Higher numbers indicate more aggressive tumors. The cause of brain tumors is largely unknown. They can occur in people of any age. Symptoms of brain tumors depend on the size and location of the tumor. The most commonsymptoms of brain tumorsare: headaches seizures numbness or tingling in your arms or legs nausea vomiting changes in personality difficulty with movementorbalance changes in your hearing, speech, or vision The type of treatment you’ll receive depends on many different factors, such as the size of the tumor, your age, and your overall health. The main types of treatment for brain tumors are: surgery chemotherapy radiation therapy Neurodegenerative diseases cause your brain and nerves to deteriorate over time. They can change your personality and cause confusion. They can also destroy your brain’s tissue and nerves. Some brain diseases, such asAlzheimer’s disease, may develop as you age. They can slowly impair your memory and thought processes. Other diseases, such asTay-Sachs disease, are genetic and begin at an early age. Other common neurodegenerative diseases include: Huntington’s disease amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), or Lou Gehrig’s disease Parkinson’s disease allforms of dementia Some of the more commonsymptoms of neurodegenerative diseasesinclude: memory loss forgetfulness apathy anxiety agitation a loss of inhibition mood changes Neurodegenerative diseases cause permanent damage, so symptoms tend to get worse as the disease progresses. New symptoms are also likely to develop over time. There’s no cure for neurodegenerative diseases, but treatment can help. The goal of treatment for these conditions it to try to reduce your symptoms and help you maintain quality of life. Treatment often involves the use of medications to better manage your symptoms. Mental health disorders, or mental health conditions, are a large and diverse group of issues that affect your behavior patterns. Some of the most frequently diagnosed mental health disorders are: depression anxiety bipolar disorder post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) schizophrenia The symptoms of mental health conditions vary based on the condition. Different people can experience the same disorder very differently. You should talk with your doctor if you notice a change in your behavior, thought patterns, or moods. The two major types of treatment for mental health conditions are medication and psychotherapy. Different methods work better for different conditions. Many people find that a combination of the two is the most effective. If you think you might have a mental health disorder, it’s important to talk and work with a doctor to create a treatment plan that works for you. There are manyresourcesavailable — do not try to self-medicate."
173,Brain Disorders,What are the risk factors for brain disorders?,"Brain disorders can affect anyone. Risk factors are different for different types of brain disorders. Traumatic brain injury ismost commonin children under 4 years old, young adults between ages 15 and 25 years, and older adults ages 65 years and older, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Brain tumors can affect people at any age. Your personal risk depends on your genetics and your exposure to environmental risk factors like radiation. Older age and family history are the most significant risk factors for neurodegenerative diseases. Mental health disorders are very common. The National Alliance on Mental Illness (NAMI) reports that about1 in 5 American adultshas experienced a mental health condition. Your risk may be higher if you: have a family history of mental health conditions have or have had traumatic or stressful life experiences have a history of misusingalcoholordrugs have or have had a traumatic brain injury"
174,Brain Disorders,How are brain disorders diagnosed?,"A primary care physician or aneurological specialistcan diagnose a brain disorder. They will likely perform a neurological exam to check your vision, hearing, and balance. They may also get images of your brain to help them make a diagnosis. The most common diagnostic imaging tools areCT,MRI, andPET scans. Your doctor might also need to study fluid from your brain and spinal cord. This helps them find bleeding in the brain, infection, and other abnormalities. Mental health disorders are usually diagnosed based on an evaluation of your symptoms and history."
175,Brain Disorders,What’s the long-term outlook?,"The outlook for people with brain disorders depends on the type and severity of the brain disorder. Some conditions are easily treated with medication and therapy. For example, millions of people with mental health disorders live full, quality lives. Other disorders, like neurodegenerative diseases and some traumatic brain injuries, have no cure. People with these conditions may often face permanent changes in their behavior, mental abilities, or coordination. In these cases, treatment centers around helping you manage the illness and retain as much independence as possible."
176,Breast Cancer,Overview,"Breast cancer occurs when breast cells develop mutations and begin to divide and multiply. People may first notice a lump in the breast, discoloration, texture changes, or other symptoms. Breast cancer is cancer that develops in breast cells. Typically, the cancer forms in either the lobules or the ducts of the breast. Lobules are the glands that produce milk, and ducts are the pathways that bring the milk from the glands to the nipple. Cancer can also occur in the fatty tissue or the fibrous connective tissue within your breast. The uncontrolled cancer cells often invade other healthy breast tissue and can travel to the lymph nodes under the arms. Once the cancer enters the lymph nodes, it has access to a pathway to move to other body parts. Although they generally have less of it, males have breast tissue just like females do. Males can develop breast cancer, too, but it’s much rarer. Learn more about the signs of breast cancer, how it’s diagnosed, and what treatment options are available."
177,Breast Cancer,Signs and symptoms of breast cancer,"In its early stages, breast cancer may not cause any symptoms. In many cases, a tumor may be too small to be felt, but an abnormality can still be seen on a mammogram. If a tumor can be felt, the first sign is usually a new lump in the breast that was not there before. However, not all lumps are cancer. Symptoms of the most common breast cancersinclude: a breast lump or tissue thickening that feels different from surrounding tissue and is new breast pain discolored and pitted skin on your breast swelling in all or part of your breast a nipple discharge other than breast milk bloody discharge from your nipple peeling, scaling, or flaking of skin on your nipple or breast a sudden, unexplained change in the shape or size of your breast inverted nipple changes to the appearance of the skin on your breasts a lump or swelling under your arm If you have any of these symptoms, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have breast cancer. For instance, pain in your breast or abreast lumpcan be caused by a benign cyst. Still, if you find a lump in your breast or have other symptoms, speak with a doctor for further examination and testing. Learn more about breast cancer symptoms and see pictures of what they can look like."
178,Breast Cancer,Types of breast cancer,"There are several types of breast cancer, which are broken into two main categories: invasive and noninvasive. Noninvasive breast cancer is also known as breast cancer in situ. While invasive cancer has spread from the breast ducts or glands to other parts of the breast, noninvasive cancer has not spread from the original tissue. Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS):DCIS is a noninvasive cancer. With DCIS, the cancer cells are confined to the ducts in your breast and haven’t invaded the surrounding breast tissue. Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS):LCIS is cancer that grows in the milk-producing glands of your breast. Like DCIS, the cancer cells haven’t invaded the surrounding tissue. Invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC):IDC is the most common type of breast cancer. It begins in your breast’s milk ducts and then invades nearby tissue in the breast. Once the breast cancer has spread to the tissue outside your milk ducts, it can begin to spread to other nearby organs and tissue. Invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC):ILCfirst develops in your breast’s lobules and then invades nearby tissue. Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC):IBC is a rare but aggressive type of breast cancer. According to the National Cancer Institute, IBC makes up only1% to 5%of all breast cancer cases. It blocks the lymph nodes near the breasts, so the lymph vessels in the breast can’t properly drain. Paget disease of the nipple:This type of breast cancer begins in the ducts of the nipple, but as it grows, it begins to affect the skin and areola of the nipple. Triple-negative breast cancer:This is another rare disease type. It affects only about10% to 15%of people with breast cancer. Angiosarcoma:This is cancer that grows on the blood vessels or lymph vessels in the breast. The type of cancer you have helps guide your treatment options and long-term outcome. Learn more about types of breast cancer. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), breast cancer is the second most common cancer in women."
179,Breast Cancer,Risk factors for breast cancer,"There are several risk factors that increase your chances of getting breast cancer. However, having any of these doesn’t mean you will definitely develop the disease. Risk factors you can changeinclude: Alcohol use:Drinking alcohol raises your risk. Hormone therapy:People who took or are taking postmenopausal estrogen and progesterone medications to help reduce their menopause symptoms have a higher risk of breast cancer. Not getting enough exercise:Those who are not physically active can often have a higher risk of cancer. Risk factors you cannot change include: Age:Your risk of developing breast cancer increases as you age. Most invasive breast cancers are found in people over 55 years old. Having dense breast tissue:Dense breast tissue makes mammograms hard to read. It also increases your risk of breast cancer. Genes:People who have the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations are more likely to develop breast cancer than people who don’t. Other gene mutations may also affect your risk. Inherited risk:If a close female relative, such as your mother, sister, or grandmother, has had breast cancer, you have an increased risk of developing it. Never having been pregnant:People who have never been pregnant or carried a pregnancy to full term are more likely to develop breast cancer. Learn more about the causes and risk factors of breast cancer."
180,Breast Cancer,Diagnosis of breast cancer,"To determine whether your symptoms are caused by breast cancer or a benign breast condition, a doctor will do a thorough physical exam in addition to a breast exam. They may also request one or more diagnostic tests to help understand what’s causing your symptoms. These include: The most common way to see below the surface of your breast is with an imaging test called amammogram. Many females over 40 years old get annual mammograms to check for breast cancer. If a doctor suspects you may have a tumor or suspicious spot, they will also request a mammogram. If an atypical area is seen on your mammogram, a doctor may request additional tests, such as abreast ultrasound. This method uses sound waves to create a picture of the tissues deep in your breast. An ultrasound can help your doctor distinguish between a solid mass, such as a tumor, and a benign cyst. If your doctor suspects breast cancer based on tests like a mammogram or an ultrasound, they may do a test called abreast biopsy. During this test, they remove a tissue sample from the suspicious area and test it in a lab. If the sample tests positive for cancer, the lab can test it further to identify the type of breast cancer. If you don’t already have a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through theHealthline FindCare tool. Learn more about Healthline’s Newly Diagnosed with Breast Cancer."
181,Breast Cancer,Breast cancer stages,"Doctors divide breast cancer intostagesbased on the size of the tumor and how much it has spread. Cancers that are large or have invaded nearby tissues or organs are at a higher stage than cancers that are small or still contained in the breast. To stage breast cancer, doctors need to know: if the cancer is invasive or noninvasive how large the tumor is whether the lymph nodes are involved if the cancer has spread to nearby tissue or organs Breast cancer hasfive main stages: stages 0 to 4. Stage 0 is ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Cancer cells in DCIS remain confined to the ducts in the breast and have not spread into nearby tissue. Stage 1A:The primary tumor is 2 centimeters (cm) wide or less. The lymph nodes are not affected. Stage 1B:Cancer is found in nearby lymph nodes. Either there is no tumor in the breast, or the tumor is smaller than 2 cm. Stage 2A:The tumor is smaller than 2 cm and has spread to one to three nearby lymph nodes, or it’s between 2 and 5 cm and hasn’t spread to any lymph nodes. Stage 2B:The tumor is between 2 and 5 cm and has spread to one to three axillary (armpit) lymph nodes, or it’s larger than 5 cm and hasn’t spread to any lymph nodes. Stage 3A:The cancer has spread to four to nine axillary lymph nodes or has enlarged the internal mammary lymph nodes. The primary tumor can be any size.Tumors are greater than 5 cm. The cancer has spread to one to three axillary lymph nodes or any breastbone nodes. The cancer has spread to four to nine axillary lymph nodes or has enlarged the internal mammary lymph nodes. The primary tumor can be any size. Tumors are greater than 5 cm. The cancer has spread to one to three axillary lymph nodes or any breastbone nodes. Stage 3B:A tumor has invaded the chest wall or skin and may or may not have invaded up to nine lymph nodes. Stage 3C:Cancer is found in 10 or more axillary lymph nodes, lymph nodes near the collarbone, or internal mammary nodes. Stage 4 breast cancer can have a tumor of any size. Its cancer cells have spread to nearby and distant lymph nodes as well as distant organs. The testing a doctor does will determine the stage of your breast cancer, which will affect your treatment. Learn more about breast cancer stages and grades."
182,Breast Cancer,Breast cancer treatment,"Your breast cancer’s stage, how far it has invaded (if it has), and how big the tumor has grown all play a large part in determining what kind of treatment you’ll need. To start, a doctor will determine your cancer’s size, stage, and grade. Your cancer’s grade describes how likely it is to grow and spread. After that, you can discuss your treatment options. Surgery is the most common treatment for breast cancer. Many people have additional treatments, such as chemotherapy, targeted therapy, radiation, or hormone therapy. Several types of surgery may be used to remove breast cancer, including: Breast-conserving surgery:Lumpectomy:This procedure removes the tumor and some surrounding tissue, leaving the rest of the breast intact. Lumpectomy:This procedure removes the tumor and some surrounding tissue, leaving the rest of the breast intact. Surgery to remove lymph nodes:Sentinel node biopsy:This surgery removes a few of the lymph nodes that receive drainage from the tumor. These lymph nodes will be tested. If they don’t have cancer, you may not need additional surgery to remove more lymph nodes.Axillary lymph node dissection:If lymph nodes removed during a sentinel node biopsy contain cancer cells, a doctor may remove additional lymph nodes. Sentinel node biopsy:This surgery removes a few of the lymph nodes that receive drainage from the tumor. These lymph nodes will be tested. If they don’t have cancer, you may not need additional surgery to remove more lymph nodes. Axillary lymph node dissection:If lymph nodes removed during a sentinel node biopsy contain cancer cells, a doctor may remove additional lymph nodes. Removal of one or both breasts:Mastectomy:In this procedure, a surgeon removes an entire breast. In a double mastectomy, they remove both breasts.Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy:Even though breast cancer may be present in only one breast, some people elect to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. This surgery removes your healthy breast to lower your risk of developing breast cancer again. Mastectomy:In this procedure, a surgeon removes an entire breast. In a double mastectomy, they remove both breasts. Contralateral prophylactic mastectomy:Even though breast cancer may be present in only one breast, some people elect to have a contralateral prophylactic mastectomy. This surgery removes your healthy breast to lower your risk of developing breast cancer again. Withradiation therapy, high powered beams of radiation are used to target and kill cancer cells. Most radiation treatments use external beam radiation. This technique uses a large machine on the outside of the body. Advances in cancer treatment have also enabled doctors to irradiate cancer from inside the body. This is known asbrachytherapy. To conduct brachytherapy, surgeons place radioactive seeds, or pellets, inside the body near the tumor site. The seeds stay there for a short period of time and work to destroy cancer cells. Chemotherapyis a drug treatment used to destroy cancer cells. Some people may undergo only chemotherapy, but this type of treatment is often used alongside other treatments, especially surgery. Some people will have surgery first followed by other treatments, such as radiation. This is called adjuvant therapy. Others may have chemotherapy first to shrink the cancer, called neoadjuvant therapy, and then surgery. In some cases, doctors prefer to give chemotherapy before surgery. The hope is that the treatment will shrink the tumor, and then the surgery will not need to be as invasive. If your type of breast cancer is sensitive to hormones, a doctor may start you onhormone therapy. Estrogen and progesterone, two female hormones, can stimulate the growth of breast cancer tumors. Hormone therapy works by blocking your body’s production of these hormones or by blocking the hormone receptors on the cancer cells. This action can help slow and possibly stop the growth of your cancer. Learn more about treatment options for breast cancer."
183,Breast Cancer,Breast cancer prevention,"While there are risk factors you can’t control, following a healthy lifestyle, getting regular screenings, and taking any preventive measures recommended by a doctor can help lower your risk of developing breast cancer. Learn more about breast cancer prevention. Lifestyle factorscan affectyour risk of breast cancer. For instance, people who haveobesityhave a higher risk of developing breast cancer. Maintaining a nutrient-dense diet and getting regular exercise as often as possible could help you lose weight and lower your risk. According to theAmerican Association for Cancer Research, drinking alcohol also increases your risk, especially drinking more than the recommended moderate amount. For females, moderate alcohol use isdefinedas one drink per day. If you drink alcohol, consider talking with a doctor about what amount they recommend for you. Having regular mammograms may not prevent breast cancer, but it can help reduce the chance that it will go undetected. TheAmerican Cancer Societyprovides the following general recommendations for those at average risk of breast cancer: Ages 40 to 44 years:an optional mammogram each year Ages 45 to 54 years:a mammogram every year Ages 55 years and older:can choose to continue with annual mammograms or switch to every other year Specific recommendations for mammograms are different for everyone, so talk with a doctor to see if you should get regular mammograms. You may have an increased risk of breast cancer due to hereditary factors. For instance, if your parent has a BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene mutation,you’re at higher riskof having it as well. This significantly raises your risk of breast cancer. If you’re at risk for this mutation, consider talking with a doctor about your diagnostic options. You may want to be tested to determine whether you have the mutation. If you learn that you do have it, talk with a doctor about any preemptive steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing breast cancer. These steps could include aprophylactic mastectomy, or surgical removal of a breast. You may also consider chemoprophylaxis, or taking medication, such asTamoxifen, to potentially reduce your breast cancer risk. Many people routinely conduct abreast self-examination. It’s best to do this exam once per month, at the same time each month. The exam can help you become familiar with how your breasts usually look and feel so that you’re aware of any changes that occur. If you’re having symptoms that concern you, it’s a good idea to have a doctor do a breast exam. During the exam, they will check both of your breasts for abnormal spots or signs of breast cancer. Learn more about what your doctor may look for during a breast exam."
184,Breast Cancer,Breast cancer outlook,"Breast cancer survival rates vary widely based on many factors. Two of the most important factors are the type of cancer you have and the stage of the cancer at the time you receive a diagnosis. Other factors that may play a role include: your age your sex your race the growth rate of the cancer Research from 2021shows there’s a higher mortality rate in people of color with breast cancer than white people with breast cancer. A key reason for this is healthcare disparities, such as a lack of access to quality care. The good news is breast cancer survival rates are improving. The 5-year relative survival rates for breast cancer differ depending on the stage at diagnosis. According to theAmerican Cancer Society, the 5-year relative survival rates for breast cancer are: 99% for localized breast cancer 86% for regional breast cancer 31% for distant breast cancer 91% for all stages combined Find out more about survival statistics and the factors that affect them."

186,Bug Bites,Overview,"The initial contact of a bite or sting from a bug may be painful. It is often followed by an allergic reaction to venom deposited into your skin through the mouth or stinger of the bug. The appearance can vary. Whether you’re in the water, on a mountain trail, or in your backyard, wildlife you encounter have ways of protecting themselves and their territory. Insects, such as bees, ants, spiders, and scorpions, may bite or sting if you get close. Most of these animals won’t bother you if you don’t bother them, but knowing what to look for is key. Most bites and stings trigger nothing more than minor discomfort, but some encounters can be deadly, especially if you have severe allergies to the animal’s venom. A severe allergic reaction can happen with any bug bite or sting, depending on the person. Venom allergies may cause a dangerous, severe allergic reaction in some people, resulting in swelling, generalized itching, and difficulty breathing. Prevention is the best medicine, so knowing how to recognize and avoid biting and stinging insects or arachnids is the best way to stay safe. Anaphylaxis can be a life threatening emergency. If someone experiences signs of a severe allergic reaction, call 911 or your local emergency services. Anaphylaxis can cause symptoms such as difficulty breathing, choking sensation, wheezing, abdominal pain, dizziness, or fainting. This can be fatal if it isn’t treated immediately."
187,Bug Bites,Pictures of bites and stings,"The form a bite takes depends onwhat typeof animal bit you. Take a look at the photos below to help identify which animal may have caused your bug bite. Warning: Graphic images ahead. Amosquito biteis a small, round, puffy bump that appears soon after you’ve been bitten. The bump will become discolored, hard, swollen, and itchy. You may have multiple bites in the same area. Fire ants are small, aggressive, red or black venomous ants that bite and then deliverpainful stings. Stings appear as swollen spots that develop a blister on top. Stings can burn and itch. Flea bitesare usually located in clusters on the lower legs and feet. The itchy bumps are surrounded by a discolored halo. Symptoms begin immediately after you’re bitten. The itchy rash is caused by an allergic reaction to the bedbug bite. The small rashes have red, swollen areas and dark red centers. Bites may appear in a line or grouped together, usually on areas of the body not covered by clothing, such as the hands, neck, or feet. There may be very itchy blisters or hives at the bite site. Read full article on bedbug bites. Painful, itchy rashes are caused by an inflammatory reaction at the site of the fly bite. Though usually harmless, they may lead to severe allergic reactions or spread insect-borne diseases. It is important to take precautions when traveling to endemic countries by wearing long-sleeve shirts and pants and by using bug spray. Headlice, pubic lice (“crabs”), and body lice are different species of parasitic lice that affect humans. They feed on blood and cause an itchy immune reaction at the site of their bites. Adult lice are gray/tan six-legged insects about the size of a tiny sesame seed. Nits (eggs) and nymphs (baby lice) can only be seen as very tiny specks that may look like dandruff. Painful, itchy rashes may be caused by an immune response to the bites of tiny mite larvae. Bites appear as welts, blisters, pimples, or hives. Bites will generally appear in groups and are extremely itchy. Chigger bites may be grouped in skin folds or near areas where clothing fits tightly. Chiggers tend to jump from grass, so bites are usually on legs near the tops of socks. Read full article on chigger bites. Bites can cause pain or swelling at the bite area. Theymay also lead toa rash, a burning sensation, blisters, or difficulty breathing. The tick often remains attached to the skin for a long time. Bites rarely appear in groups. Symptoms caused byscabies mitesmay take4 to 6 weeksto appear. The extremely itchy rash may be pimply, made up of tiny blisters, or scales. They may cause raised, white, or flesh-toned lines. Most spiders don’t pose a threat to humans, and in such cases, their bites are harmless or mildly irritating like a bee sting. Dangerous spiders include the brown recluse, black widow, funnel web spider (Australia), and wandering spider (South America). A single raised papule, pustule, or wheal may appear at the site of the bite followed by redness and tenderness. Thebitewill appear as two small puncture marks. Severe allergic reactions to a spider bite may require medical attention. This is a brown- or tan-colored spider with a violin-shaped patch and six paired eyes, two in the front and two sets of two on either side of the head. It likes to hide in quiet, dark places like closets and bookshelves and is native to the South and South Central regions of the United States. It is deemed non-aggressive and will only bite humans if it’s being crushed between the skin and a hard surface. It may cause redness or other color changes with a central blister at the site of the bite. Rare complications include fever, body aches, nausea, vomiting,hemolytic anemia,rhabdomyolysis, andkidney failure. Abite from a black widow spider causes a sharp pain, like a pin prick. This is followed by dull, sometimes numbing pain around the site. This spider is plump, black, and shiny, with an hourglass-shaped red mark on its abdomen. It’s nonaggressive and will only bite if it’s being crushed. Muscle pain and cramping can often develop within a few hours. You should seek medical attention if symptoms extend beyond the bite site. The venom of this common household spiderisn’t considered toxic to humans. Bites are generally harmless and cause only minor pain, swelling, and sometimes muscle twitches. A single disclored area appears with a tender central nodule. Itching, burning, or stinging may occur at the site of the bite. This large (up to two inches long), fuzzy, gray/brown spider is native to many parts of the United States. It is typically nonaggressive, but will bite if it feels threatened. These large (one-inch long) blood-sucking flies are most active in the daylight hours. An instant, sharp burning sensation occurs when a horsefly bites. Itchiness, swelling, and bruising may also occur at the bite location. Pain, discoloration, swelling, or itching occurs at the site of the sting. Unlike bumblebees and carpenter bees, honeybees can only sting once due to their barbed stinger that can remain in the skin. These thin wasps have black and yellow stripes and long dark wings. Aggressive, a yellow jacket may sting multiple times. Swelling, tenderness, itchiness, or discoloration may occur near the area that’s been stung. Sharp pain, swelling, and itching or burning occurs at the sting site. A raised welt appears around the sting site. Wasps can be aggressive and are capable of stinging multiple times. Scorpions are eight-legged arachnids with large pincers and long, segmented, stinger-tipped tails carried in a forward curve over their backs. Many species with variable levels of toxicity can be found all over the world. Intense pain, tingling, numbness, and swelling occur around the sting. Rare symptoms include breathing difficulties, muscle twitching, vomiting, restlessness, and excitability. Severe symptoms are more likely in infants and children than adults. Triatomine bugs, also calledkissing bugs, tend to bite people on the face or near the mouth. These bugs tend to reside in Mexico, Central America, South America, and parts of the United States. They carry a parasite calledTrypanosoma cruziand canT. cruziinfection andChagas disease. While there are different varieties of kissing bugs, they typically have a cone-shaped head and a long, oval-shaped body with antennae and six legs. They can be light brown to black in color and may have yellow, red, or tan markings. Bite reactions may include mild itching, discoloration, and swelling. With aT. cruziinfection, a small hard area may form at the bite site. Deer flies have small, round heads, brownish-black bands on their wings, and gold or green eyes. Their bites can be painful and cause bumps or welts. Their bites can sometimes cause a rare bacterial disease known astularemia (rabbit fever)that may cause skin ulcers, fever, and headache."
188,Bug Bites,Types of biting and stinging insects and arachnids,"Here are some bugs that can be more dangerous than others: spiders, such asbrown recluse spiders,black widow spiders, and mouse spiders stinging insects, such asbees, paper wasps (hornets), andyellow jackets scorpions, such as the Arizona bark scorpion Many larger insects and other bugs won’t seek you out but will bite if handled."
189,Bug Bites,Who is at risk of bites and stings?,"Anyone can be bitten or stung by an insect or arachnid, and bites and stings are very common. You’re at greater risk if you spend a lot of time outdoors, especially in rural or wooded locations. Children and older adults may have more severe reactions to bites and stings."
190,Bug Bites,What are the symptoms of a bad reaction to bites and stings?,"If you’re bitten or stung, you may see or feel the animal on your skin during the attack. Some people don’t notice the animal and may not be aware of a bite or sting until one or more of the following symptoms emerge: swelling rash pain in the affected area or in the muscles itching heat on and around the site of the bite or sting numbness or tingling in the affected area Symptoms of a severe reaction requiring immediate medical treatment include: fever difficulty breathing nausea or vomiting muscle spasms rapid heart rate swelling of the lips and throat confusion loss of consciousness If you feel ill or experience flu-like symptoms in the days following an insect or arachnid bite, see a doctor for tests to rule out infections or diseases you may have contracted from the animal."
191,Bug Bites,Diagnosing bites and stings,"Many people are aware they’ve been bitten or stung because they see the insect or arachnid shortly after the attack. Although you shouldn’t further provoke an attacking insect or arachnid, try to preserve the animal if it dies following the bite or sting. This may help a doctor properly diagnose your symptoms. This is especially important for a spider bite, as some species have dangerously potent venom."
192,Bug Bites,Treating bites and stings,"The majority of bites and stings can be treated at home, especially if your reaction is mild. To treat a bite or sting: Remove the stingerif it’s lodged in your skin by using your fingernail or a piece of gauze to scrape over it. Avoid using tweezers, as this can cause more venom to deposit into your skin. Wash the affected area. Apply an ice pack to reduce pain and swelling. Topical anti-itch creams,oral pain relievers, andantihistaminescan be used to combat uncomfortable symptoms. You may also want to consider applying a thin paste of baking soda and water to the sting to calm the itching. Call 911 or your local emergency services number immediately if symptoms of a severe reaction are present. First aid instructions while waiting for paramedics to arrive include: loosening the person’s clothing laying them on their side performing CPRif breathing or the heartbeat stops If you believe a spider of the black widow or brown recluse variety has bitten you, contact 911 or local emergency services immediately even if symptoms seem minor or haven’t emerged. Scorpion and spider bites should betreated as an emergency. You should seek immediate medical attention when symptoms are felt beyond the location of the bite. Optum Now is operated by RVO Health.

193,Bug Bites,The bottom line,"Most bites and stings heal by themselves after several days of mild discomfort. It is important to monitor the affected site for signs of infection. and contact a doctor if the wound appears to be getting worse or hasn’t healed after several weeks. Bites and stings that cause severe reactions can be fatal if they aren’t treated immediately. Once you’ve experienced a severe allergic reaction, a doctor will likely prescribe an epinephrine auto-injector. Epinephrine is a hormone that can prevent anaphylactic shock. You should carry the auto-injector with you at all times to reverse the reaction immediately following a bite or sting.

194,Burns,Overview,"Burns are classified from first to third degree. Most people recover without serious health consequences, but more severe burns require emergency medical care to prevent complications and death. Burns are one of the most common household injuries, especially among children. The term “burn” means more than the burning sensation associated with this injury. Burns are characterized by severe skin damage that causes the affected skin cells to die. Read on to learn how to identify first, second, and third-degree burns and how they’re treated."
195,Burns,Pictures of burns,
196,Burns,Burn levels,"There are three primary types of burns: first-, second-, and third-degree. Each degree is based on the severity of damage to the skin, with first-degree being the most minor and third-degree being the most severe. Damage includes: first-degree burns: red, nonblistered skin second-degree burns: blisters and some thickening of the skin third-degree burns: widespread thickness with a white, leathery appearance There are also fourth-degree burns. This type of burn includes all of the symptoms of a third-degree burn and also extends beyond the skin into tendons and bones. Burns have a variety of causes, including: scalding from hot, boiling liquids chemical burns electrical burns fires, including flames from matches, candles, and lighters excessive sun exposure The type of burn is not based on the cause of it. Scalding, for example, can cause all three burns, depending on how hot the liquid is and how long it stays in contact with the skin. Chemical and electrical burns warrant immediate medical attention because they can affect the inside of the body, even if skin damage is minor."
197,Burns,First-degree burn,"First-degree burns cause minimal skin damage. They are also called “superficial burns” because they affect the outermost layer of skin. Signs of a first-degree burn include: redness minor inflammation, or swelling pain dry, peeling skin occurs as the burn heals Since this burn affects the top layer of skin, the signs and symptoms disappear once the skin cells shed. First-degree burns usually heal within 7 to 10 days without scarring. You should still see your doctor if the burn affects a large area of skin, more than three inches, and if it’s on your face or a major joint, which include: knee ankle foot spine shoulder elbow forearm First-degree burns are usually treated withhome care. Healing time may be quicker the sooner you treat the burn. Treatments for a first-degree burn include: soaking the wound in cool water for five minutes or longer taking acetaminophen or ibuprofen for pain relief applying lidocaine (an anesthetic) with aloe vera gel or cream to soothe the skin using anantibiotic ointmentand loose gauze to protect the affected area Make sure you don’t use ice, as this may make the damage worse. Never apply cotton balls to a burn because the small fibers can stick to the injury and increase the risk of infection. Also, avoidhome remedieslike butter and eggs as these are not proven to be effective."
198,Burns,Second-degree burn,"Second-degree burns are more serious because the damage extends beyond the top layer of skin. This type burn causes the skin toblisterand become extremely red and sore. Some blisters pop open, giving the burn a wet or weeping appearance. Over time, thick, soft, scab-like tissue called fibrinous exudate may develop over the wound. Due to the delicate nature of these wounds, keeping the area clean and bandaging it properly is required to prevent infection. This also helps the burn heal quicker. Some second-degree burns take longer than three weeks to heal, but most heal within two to three weeks without scarring, but often with pigment changes to the skin. The worse the blisters are, the longer the burn will take to heal. In some severe cases,skin graftingis required to fix the damage. Skin grafting takes healthy skin from another area of the body and moves it to the site of the burned skin. As with first-degree burns, avoid cotton balls and questionable home remedies. Treatments for a mild second-degree burn generally include: running the skin under cool water for 15 minutes or longer taking over-the-counter pain medication (acetaminophen or ibuprofen) applying antibiotic cream to blisters However, seek emergency medical treatment if the burn affects a widespread area, such as any of the following: face hands buttocks groin feet"
199,Burns,Third-degree burn,"Excluding fourth-degree burns, third-degree burns are the most severe. They cause the most damage, extending through every layer of skin. There is a misconception that third-degree burns are the most painful. However, with this type of burn the damage is so extensive that there may not be any pain because of nerve damage. Depending on the cause, the symptoms third-degree burns can exhibit include: waxy and white color char dark brown color raised and leathery texture blisters that do not develop Without surgery, these wounds heal with severescarringand contracture. There is no set timeline for complete spontaneous healing for third-degree burns. Never attempt to self-treat a third-degree burn.Call 911 immediately. While you’re waiting for medical treatment, raise the injury above your heart. Don’t get undressed, but make sure no clothing is stuck to the burn."
200,Burns,Complications,"Compared with first- and second-degree burns, third-degree burns carry the most risk for complications, such asinfections, blood loss, andshock, which is often what could lead to death. At the same time, all burns carry the risk of infections because bacteria can enter broken skin. Tetanusis another possible complication with burns of all levels. Likesepsis, tetanus is a bacterial infection. It affects the nervous system, eventually leading to problems with muscle contractions. As a rule of thumb, every member of your household should receive updated tetanus shots every 10 years to prevent this type of infection. Severe burns also carry the risk ofhypothermiaandhypovolemia. Dangerously low body temperatures characterize hypothermia. While this may seem like an unexpected complication of a burn, the condition is actually prompted by excessive loss of body heat from an injury. Hypovolemia, or low blood volume, occurs when your body loses too much blood from a burn."
201,Burns,Preventing all degrees of burns,"The obvious best way to fight burns is to prevent them from happening. Certain jobs put you at a greater risk for burns, but the fact is that most burns happen at home. Infants and young children are the most vulnerable to burns. Preventive measures you can take at home include: Keep children out of the kitchen while cooking. Turn pot handles toward the back of the stove. Place a fire extinguisher in or near the kitchen. Test smoke detectors once a month. Replace smoke detectors every 10 years. Keep water heater temperature under 120 degrees Fahrenheit. Measure bath water temperature before use. Lock up matches and lighters. Install electrical outlet covers. Check and discard electrical cords with exposed wires. Keep chemicals out of reach, and wear gloves during chemical use. Wearsunscreenevery day, and avoid peak sunlight. Ensure all smoking products are stubbed out completely. Clean out dryer lint traps regularly. It’s also important to have a fire escape plan and to practice it with your family once a month. In the event of a fire, make sure to crawl underneath smoke. This will minimize the risk of passing out and becoming trapped in a fire."
202,Burns,Outlook for burns,"When properly and quickly treated, the outlook for first- and second-degree burns is good. These burns rarely scar but can result in a change in pigment of the skin that was burned. The key is to minimize further damage and infection. Extensive damage from severe second-degree and third-degree burns can lead to problems in deep skin tissues, bones, and organs. Patients may require: surgery physical therapy rehabilitation lifelong assisted care It’s important to gain adequate physical treatment for burns, but don’t forget to find help for your emotional needs. There are support groups available for people who have experienced severe burns, as well as certified counselors. Go online or talk to your doctor to find support groups in your area. You can also use other resources such as Burn Survivor Assistance and theChildren’s Burn Foundation."
203,Cavities,Overview,"Tooth cavities are caused by plaque buildup in your teeth. It can lead to tooth sensitivity and pain. However, there are many treatment options."
204,Cavities,What are cavities?,"A cavity, also called tooth decay, is a hole that forms in your tooth. Cavities start small and gradually become bigger when they’re left untreated. Because many cavities don’t cause pain in the beginning, it can be hard to realize that a problem exists. Regular dental appointments can detect tooth decay early. According to theMayo Clinic, cavities and tooth decay are some of the most common health problems in the world. Anyone with teeth can develop cavities, including babies. Finding out that you have a cavity might come as a surprise. This is especially true if you think you have a good oral hygiene routine. However, even if your dentist delivers this news, there are ways to treat a cavity and prevent new ones from forming."
205,Cavities,Symptoms of tooth cavities,The symptoms of a cavity depend on the severity of the decay. They include: tooth sensitivity tooth pain a visible hole in your teeth blackorwhite stainingon your teeth
206,Cavities,Causes of tooth cavities,"Tooth cavities are caused by plaque, a sticky substance that binds to teeth. Plaque is a combination of: bacteria saliva acid food particles Everyone has bacteria in their mouth. After eating or drinking foods with sugar, bacteria in your mouth turn sugar into acid. Plaque starts forming on your teeth soon after eating or drinking anything sugary. This is whyregular brushingis important. Plaque sticks to your teeth, and the acid in plaque can slowlyerode tooth enamel. Enamel is a hard, protective coating on your teeth that protects against tooth decay. As your tooth enamel weakens, the risk for decay increases. Everyone is at risk for cavities, but some people have a higher risk. Risk factors include: too many sugary or acidic foods and drinks a poor oral hygiene routine, such as failing to brush or floss daily not getting enough fluoride dry mouth eating disorders, such asanorexiaandbulimia acid reflux disease, which can result in stomach acid wearing down your tooth enamel Cavities develop more often in the back teeth, according to theMayo Clinic. These teeth have grooves and openings that can trap food particles. Also, these teeth are sometimes harder to reach when brushing and flossing."
207,Cavities,Treatment options for tooth cavities,"Tell your doctor about uncomfortable symptoms like tooth sensitivity or pain. Your dentist can identify tooth decay after an oral exam. TheHealthline FindCare toolcan provide options in your area if you don’t already have a dentist. However, some cavities aren’t visible from an oral exam. So your dentist may use a dentalX-rayto look for decay. Treatment options depend on severity. There are several ways to treat a cavity. A dentist uses a drill and removes decayed material from a tooth. Your dentist then fills your tooth with a substance, such as silver, gold, or composite resin. For more severe decay, your dentist may place a custom-fit cap over your tooth to replace its natural crown. Your dentist will remove decayed tooth material before starting this procedure. When tooth decay causes the death of your nerves, your dentist will perform a root canal to save your tooth. They remove the nerve tissue, blood vessel tissues, and any decayed areas of your tooth. Your dentist then checks for infections and applies medication to the roots as needed. Finally, they fill the tooth, and they might even place a crown on it. If your dentist detects a tooth cavity in its early stage, a fluoride treatment may restore your tooth enamel and prevent further decay. Cavities and tooth decay can be the cause of a lot of pain and discomfort. You may want to find ways to soothe irritation while you wait for your dentist appointment. According to theMayo Clinic, there are a few things you can do to deal with discomfort temporarily: Keep up your oral hygiene routine.Continue to brush and clean all parts of your mouth, including any sensitive areas. Try over-the-counter (OTC) pain relievers.Check with your doctor if you can use OTC anesthetics. Watch what you eat.Stay away from extremely hot or cold foods when eating or drinking."
208,Cavities,Complications from tooth cavities,"A tooth cavity can cause a variety of complications if it’s left untreated. These include: ongoing tooth pain a tooth abscess, which can become infected and trigger life-threatening complications, like an infection that enters the bloodstream orsepsis the development of pus around the infected tooth an increased risk for breaking or chipping a tooth difficulty chewing food You may cause damage to your tooth that can’t be reversed if you put off seeing a dentist. At this point, the only way to fix the cavity is for your dentist to remove the tooth and replace it with an implant or bridge."
209,Cavities,Preventing tooth cavities,"Tooth cavities are a common dental problem, but you can reduce your risk by doing the following: Brush your teeth at least twice per day with a fluoride toothpaste. Floss at least once daily, as recommended by theAmerican Dental Association. Eat fewer sugary and acidic foods, like sweets, candy, juice, soda, and refined carbohydrates. Limit snacking between meals. Consider getting dental sealants on your teeth. The following foods can help fight tooth decay: fiber-rich fruits and vegetables calcium-rich foods xylitol sugarless chewing gum unsweetened black or green tea water with fluoride Also, don’t forget to visit your dentist at least twice per year for regular teeth cleanings. This allows you to get treatment for any problems your dentist finds, and it will help prevent future dental problems. “”””"
210,Chest Pain,Overview,"When you have chest pain, your first thought may be that it’s a heart attack. However, other less serious conditions can also cause chest pain. Chest pain is one of the most common reasons that people visit the emergency room (ER). Chest pain varies depending on the person. It also varies in: quality intensity duration location It may feel like a sharp, stabbing pain or a dull ache. It may be a sign of a serious heart-related problem or due to a common cause that isn’t life threatening."
211,Chest Pain,What causes chest pain?,"When you have chest pain, your first thought may be that you’re having aheart attack. While chest pain is awell-established signof a heart attack, it can also be caused by many other less serious conditions. According to one study, only5.5 percentof all ER visits for chest pain result in a diagnosis of a serious heart-related problem. The following are heart-related causes of chest pain: heart attack, which is a blockage of blood flow to the heart angina, which is chest pain caused by blockages in the blood vessels leading to your heart pericarditis, which is an inflammation of the sac around the heart myocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle cardiomyopathy, which is a disease of the heart muscle aortic dissection, which is a rare condition involving a tear of the aorta, the large vessel that comes off of the heart The following are gastrointestinal causes of chest pain: acid reflux, or heartburn, especially after eating swallowing problemsrelated to disorders of the esophagus gallstones, which can lead to upper abdominal pain or pain after eating inflammation of thegallbladderorpancreas The following are lung-related causes of chest pain: pneumonia, which causes pain that may get worse with breathing viral bronchitis, which can cause soreness around your chest and muscle aches pneumothorax(collapsed lung), causing a sudden onset of chest pain ablood clot, orpulmonary embolus, which can cause sharp pain that worsens with breathing bronchospasm, which causes chest tightness Bronchospasms commonly occur in people who haveasthmaand related disorders such aschronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The following are causes of chest pain related to the muscles or bones: bruised or broken ribs, which may be due to an injury to your chest sore muscles from exertion or chronic pain syndromes compression fracturescausing pressure on a nerve Shinglescan cause chest pain. You may develop pain along your back or chest before the shingles rash becomes apparent.Panic attackscan also cause chest pain."
212,Chest Pain,What symptoms may occur with chest pain?,"You may have other symptoms that occur with chest pain. Identifying symptoms you may be having can help your doctor make a diagnosis. These include: While pain is the most common symptom of a heart problem, some people experience other symptoms, with or without chest pain. Women, in particular, may report atypical symptoms that are later identified as being the result of a heart condition: chest pressure ortightness back,jaw, orarmpain fatigue lightheadedness dizziness shortness of breath(dyspnea) abdominal pain nausea pain during exertion Symptoms that may indicate your chest pain isn’t heart-related include: a sour oracidictaste in your mouth pain that only occurs after youswallowor eat difficulty swallowing pain that’s better or worse depending on your body position pain that’s worse when youbreathe deeplyor cough pain accompanied by arash fever aches chills runny nose cough feelings of panic or anxiety hyperventilating back pain that radiates to the front of your chest"
213,Chest Pain,How is chest pain diagnosed?,"Seek emergency treatment immediately if you think you may be having a heart attack and especially if your chest pain is new, unexplained, or lasts more than a few moments. Your doctor will ask you some questions, and your answers can help them diagnose the cause of your chest pain. Be prepared to discuss any related symptoms and to share information about any medications, treatments, or other medical conditions you may have. Your doctor may order tests to help diagnose or eliminate heart-related problems as a cause of your chest pain. These may include: anelectrocardiogram (ECG or EKG), which records your heart’s electrical activity blood tests, which measure enzyme levels achest X-ray, which is used to examine your heart, lungs, and blood vessels anechocardiogram, which uses sound waves to record moving images of your heart anMRI, which is used to look for damage to your heart or aorta stress tests, which are used to measure your heart function after exertion anangiogram, which is used to look for blockages in specific arteries If you need help finding a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through theHealthline FindCare tool."
214,Chest Pain,How is chest pain treated?,"Your doctor might treat chest pain with medication, noninvasive procedures, surgery, or a combination of these methods.

Once your doctor makes a diagnosis, they can recommend additional treatments to help you manage your condition."
216,Chlamydia,Overview,"Chlamydia is a sexually transmitted infection (STI) that’s not always accompanied by symptoms. However, if left untreated, chlamydia can lead to serious complications. Chlamydia is an STI caused by a specific strain of bacteria known asChlamydia trachomatis. Many people who have chlamydia often don’t have outward symptoms in the early stages. Untreated chlamydia can cause serious complications, so it’s important to get regular screenings and talk with a doctor or another healthcare professional if you have any concerns."
217,Chlamydia,How is chlamydia transmitted?,"Sexual activity without a condom or other barrier method is the main way a chlamydia infection can be transmitted. Penetration doesn’t have to occur to contract it. Touching genitals together may transmit the bacteria through secretions. Contact with the mouth, lips, or tongue may also be enough totransmitchlamydia during oral sex. However, this is less common. It can alsooccur in the eyesthrough direct or indirect contact with the bacteria. For example, if you touch your eye without washing your hands, the infection can move from the genitals to the eye. Newborn babies can acquire chlamydia during birth. Mostprenatal testingincludes a chlamydia test, but it doesn’t hurt to double-check with an OB-GYN during thefirst prenatal checkup. Chlamydia is the most common bacterial STI in the United States. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 1.6 million cases of chlamydia were reported in 2023. The number of people affected is likelymuch higherdue to the asymptomatic nature of most infections. It’s particularly common among young adults, with the highest rates occurring in people ages 15 to 24. In 2023, 55.8% of reported cases were in this age group."
218,Chlamydia,What are the symptoms of a chlamydia infection?,"Chlamydia is often referred to as a “silent infection” because most people with a chlamydia infection don’t experience any symptoms. However, it can cause several symptoms in others, including: abnormal discharge from the anus or genitals anal bleeding or discharge bleeding between periods cervix inflammation (cervicitis) pain during urination pain during penetration pain in the lower abdomen pain in the testicles If you have chlamydia in the throat, symptoms can include asore throat,cough, or fever. If you have a chlamydia eye infection, also known as chlamydial conjunctivitis, the following symptoms may occur: redness swelling itching irritation mucus or discharge sensitivity to light (photophobia) When symptoms do occur, they may be similar to those of other STIs.See photos of symptoms caused by different STIs to understand the visible effects these infections can have."
219,Chlamydia,How is chlamydia diagnosed?,"Your healthcare professional will likely perform aphysical exam. This lets them observe any discharge, sores, or unusual spots that may be related to a possible infection. They may swab the sore or other areas of possible infection, including the vaginal canal, penile urethra, anus, and throat. But in most cases, healthcare professionals recommend a urine test. The results of a swab or urine test may take several days to arrive. If your test result is positive, a healthcare professional will contact you to schedule a follow-up appointment and discuss treatment. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
220,Chlamydia,How is chlamydia treated?,"Chlamydia can be cured with antibiotics. Doxycyclineis an antibiotic that must be taken twice daily for 1 week.Azithromycinis an antibiotic usually prescribed in a single, large dose. In some cases, a different antibiotic may be prescribed. It’s important to take the full course of medication and to avoid partner sex andsex toy useuntil the infection has cleared. Your healthcare professional will advise you on how long you should wait.

221,Chlamydia,What happens if chlamydia is left untreated?,"Some people developpelvic inflammatory disease (PID), an infection that can damage the uterus, cervix, and ovaries. This can lead to chronic pelvic pain. Scarring in the fallopian tubes can result in infertility. Theepididymis— the tube that holds the testicles in place — may become inflamed, causing pain. This is known asepididymitis. In rare cases, epididymitis can lead to decreased sperm production and infertility. The infection can also spread to the prostate gland, causing a fever and pain in the lower back. This is known as prostatitis. Congenital chlamydia can lead to eye infections andpneumonia."
222,Chlamydia,What can you do to reduce your risk of contracting chlamydia?,"Abstaining from sexual activityis the only guaranteed way to prevent chlamydia and other STIs. However, if you are sexually active, there are several steps you can take to decrease your risk: Use barrier methods:Using a condom,dental dam, or other barrier method each time you have oral, vaginal, or anal sex significantly decreases the risk of infection. This includes partner sex with a dildo or other sex toy. Get tested: Regular screening for STIs is crucial for prompt diagnosis and treatment. Healthcare professionals often recommend testing at least once a year, between partners, or before engaging with a new partner. Communicate: Taking steps to protect your individual health is important, but there are benefits to making this a shared practice. Getting tested together, for example, can be an intimate experience."
223,Chlamydia,Other frequently asked questions,"It’s important to finish the full course of antibiotics before having partner sex. It’s possible to transmit the infection to a partner if you engage in sexual contact before you each complete treatment. Your healthcare professional may advise you to wait 1 to 2 weeks, depending on the type of antibiotic prescribed. It’s important to finish the full course of antibiotics before having partner sex.

However, this could also be a sign of several other infections, includingbacterial vaginosisortrichomoniasis. It could also be caused by many other factors, including sweat, changes in pH, or shifts in hormone levels. Consider talking with a healthcare professional to address any concerns regarding abnormal discharge or odor, especially if it’s accompanied by other symptoms like pain, bleeding, itching, or burning. Chlamydia andgonorrheaare common bacterial STIs. They’re usually asymptomatic, but when symptoms do occur, they’re often similar. This includes pain or burning during urination and unusual anal or genital discharge.People with chlamydia may experience symptoms within a few weeks of exposure. With gonorrhea, it can be much longer before symptoms appear, if at all. Both STIs are curable with antibiotics. Chlamydia andgonorrheaare common bacterial STIs.

225,Crohn's Disease,Overview,"Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that most commonly occurs in the small intestine and colon. It may also affect any part of your gastrointestinal tract from mouth to anus, and can involve some parts while skipping others. Symptoms of Crohn’s disease may include diarrhea, abdominal cramps, bloody stools, fever, and the frequent need to pass a bowel movement, among others. Treatment options like medication and dietary changes can help manage symptoms, but around 8 in 10 people with Crohn’s disease will require surgery at some point in their lives. Crohn’s disease is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). As many as780,000 Americanshave the condition, according to the Crohn’s & Colitis Foundation of America (CCFA). More research onCrohn’s diseaseis necessary. Researchers aren’t sure how it begins, who is most likely to develop it, or how to best manage it. Despite major treatment advances in the last three decades, no cure is available yet. Crohn’s disease most commonly occurs in the small intestine and the colon. It can affect any part of yourgastrointestinal (GI) tract, from the mouth to the anus. It can involve some parts of the GI tract and skip other parts. The range of severity for Crohn’s is mild to debilitating. Symptoms vary and can change over time. In severe cases, the disease can lead to life threatening flares and complications. Here’s everything you need to know about Crohn’s disease."
226,Crohn's Disease,Crohn’s disease symptoms,"The symptoms of Crohn’s disease often develop gradually. Certain symptoms may also become worse over time. Although it’s possible, it’srarefor symptoms to develop suddenly and dramatically. The earliest symptoms of Crohn’s disease can include: diarrhea abdominal cramps blood in your stool fever fatigue loss of appetite unexplained weight loss feeling as if your bowels aren’t empty after a bowel movement feeling afrequent need for bowel movements It’s sometimes possible to mistake these symptoms for those of another condition, such asfood poisoning, anupset stomach, or an allergy. You should see your doctor if any of these symptoms persist. The symptoms may become more severe as the disease progresses. More serious symptoms may include: aperianal fistula, which causes pain and drainage near your anus ulcers that may occur anywhere from the mouth to the anus inflammation of the joints and skin shortness of breath or decreased ability to exercise due to anemia Early detection and diagnosis can help you avoid severe complications and allow you to begin treatment early."
227,Crohn's Disease,What are the variations of Crohn’s disease?,"There are five variations of Crohn’s disease, all based on location in the digestive system. They are: Gastroduodenal Crohn’s disease:This typeaffects the stomach and the duodenum, which is the first part of your small intestine. Jejunoileitis:This type affects the second portion of your intestine, called the jejunum. Ileitis:This type affects the ileum, which is the last part of the small intestine. Ileocolitis:This type affects the ileum and the colon. Crohn’s colitis:This type affects the colon only. In addition, Crohn’s disease can present asperianal disease, which involves fistulas (abnormal connections between tissues), deep tissue infections, as well as sores and ulcers on the outer skin around the anus."
228,Crohn's Disease,What causes Crohn’s disease?,"It isn’t clear what causes Crohn’s disease. One possibility is that it’s a type ofautoimmune condition. This is a type of condition in whichyour immune system mistakenly attacksyour body, sometimes causing inflammation. Though the immune system could be a potential contributor to inflammation in Crohn’s, it has not yet been classified asan autoimmune conditionas the causes are still not fully understood. The following factors may influence your chances of developing it: inheriting certain genes having relativeswith the disease, and in particular,having a twinwith the disease smoking using medications likeoral contraceptives, antibiotics, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) living in an urban environment"
229,Crohn's Disease,Crohn’s disease diagnosis,"Crohn’s is typically diagnosedbased on the results of tissue samples taken from your digestive tract during an upper or lowerendoscopy. Othertestsmay also point to Crohn’s disease, and their results — combined with your symptoms and history — will be taken into consideration. These testsincludeblood andstool tests, as well as anendoscopyandcolonoscopy, during which your doctor will likely do abiopsy. You may also need imaging tests likeCTandMRI. Once the doctor reviews the results of all the tests and gets a clear picture of your symptoms, they may conclude you have Crohn’s disease. Your doctor may go on to request these tests several more times to look for affected tissue and determine how the disease is progressing. TheHealthline FindCare toolcan provide options in your area if you need help finding aprimary care doctoror a gastroenterologist."
230,Crohn's Disease,Treatment for Crohn’s disease,"A cure for Crohn’s disease isn’t available yet, but the disease can be managed. A variety of treatment options exist that can lessen the severity and frequency of your symptoms. Several types of medications are available to treat Crohn’s. These include: antidiarrheals anti-inflammatory drugs biologics immunomodulators Antibioticsmay help reduce some of the symptoms of Crohn’s and some of the possible triggers for it. For example, antibioticscan reducedrainage and healfistulas, which are abnormal connections between tissues that Crohn’s can cause. If less invasive treatments and lifestyle changes don’t improve your symptoms,surgerymay be necessary. Ultimately,about 80%of people with Crohn’s disease will require surgery at some point in their lives, according to the CCFA. Types of surgeries include: strictureplasty bowel resection ostomy colectomy proctocolectomy Crohn’s disease surgery is helpful for relieving symptoms, but it’s not without risk. Talk with your doctor about any concerns you may have with surgery. Food doesn’t cause Crohn’s disease, but it can trigger flares. A diet plan that works for one person with Crohn’s disease may not work for another. This is because the disease can involve different areas of the GI tract in different people. It’s important to find out what works best for you. This can be done by keeping track of your symptoms as you add or remove certain foods from your diet and in consultation with your doctor or a registered dietitian. Lifestyle and diet changes that may help you include: Reduce fiber:For some people, foods with fiber may aggravate the GI tract. If this is true for you, you may need to switch to alow residue diet.Researchon this particular diet has been mixed, so speak with your doctor about your personal needs. Limit fat:Crohn’s disease may interfere with your body’s ability to break down and absorb fat. However, a2017 studyon mice suggested that a diet higher in plant-based fats may positively affect thegut microbiomein people with Crohn’s disease. More research is needed, and your doctor or a registered dietitian can help guide you in your fat intake. Limit dairy:Even if you’re notlactose intolerant, your bodycan develop difficultydigesting some dairy products when you have Crohn’s disease. Consuming dairy can lead to an upset stomach, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea for some people. Drink water:Crohn’s disease may affect your body’s ability to absorb water from your digestive tract. This can lead todehydration. The risk ofdehydrationis especially high if you’re having diarrhea or bleeding. Take vitamin and mineral supplements:Crohn’s disease can affect your intestines’ ability to properly absorb other nutrients from your food. Eatingnutrient-dense foodsmay not be enough. Talk with your doctor about takingmultivitaminsto find out if this is right for you. Some people usecomplementary and alternative medicine (CAM)to help manage symptoms of various conditions and diseases, including Crohn’s disease. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) hasn’t approved these for treatment, but some people use them in addition to mainstream medications. Don’t add any new treatments to your current treatment plan without consulting your doctor. Some CAM treatments for Crohn’s disease include: Probiotics:Thesemay help prevent microorganisms from upsetting your gut’s natural balance and causing a Crohn’s flare. Scientific data about effectiveness is limited. Prebiotics: These arepotentially beneficial materialsfound in plants that help feed the good bacteria in your gut and increase their numbers. Fish oil:Oily fish like salmon and mackerel are rich inomega-3s.Researchis ongoing regarding the use offish oilin the treatment of Crohn’s disease. Supplements:Some herbs, vitamins, and minerals may help ease the symptoms of Crohn’s disease.Researchis ongoing as to which supplements may be beneficial. Acupuncture:Researchhas found thatacupuncture, combined withmoxibustion— a type of traditional Chinese medicine that involves burning dried medicinal herbs on or near your skin — may help improve some symptoms. Tell your doctor if you use any CAM treatments or over-the-counter medications. Some of these substances can affect the efficiency of medications or other treatments. In some cases, an interaction or side effect could be dangerous or even life threatening."
231,Crohn's Disease,Frequently asked questions,"According to aCanadian study from 2020, the average life expectancy for women with IBD was 78.4 years, and the average life expectancy for men with IBD was 75.5 years. Most people with Crohn’s disease receive a diagnosis in their 20s and 30s, butIBDcan develop in children, too. Approximately1 in 4 peoplewith an IBD show symptoms before age 18. Untreated Crohn’s in children can lead togrowth delaysand weakened bones. However, Crohn’s medications can have some significant side effects on children. It’s vital you work closely with your child’s doctor to find the right options. Crohn’s disease andulcerative colitis (UC)are two types of IBD. They have many of the same characteristics. You may even mistake them for one another. That said, there are also some differences.Learn more about Crohn’s disease versus ulcerative colitis."
232,Crohn's Disease,Outlook,"Research is still ongoing to find more effective treatments and potentially an eventual cure for Crohn’s disease. But symptoms can be successfully managed, and remission is possible. Your doctor can help guide you in finding the right medications, alternative treatments, and lifestyle measures that can help. If you’re having gastrointestinal symptoms, speak with your doctor to determine the cause and potential solutions.

233,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),Overview,"The extreme and persistent fatigue from CFS lasts for at least 6 months and doesn’t go away with bed rest. Medications along with diet and lifestyle changes may help you manage symptoms. Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a disorder characterized by extremefatigueor tiredness that doesn’t go away with rest and can’t be explained by an underlying medical condition. CFS can also be referred to as myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME) or systemic exertion intolerance disease (SEID). The causes of CFS aren’t fully understood yet. Some theories includeviral infection, psychologicalstress, or a combination of factors. Because no single cause has been identified, and because many other conditions produce similar symptoms, CFS can be difficult to diagnose. There are no tests for CFS. Your doctor will have to rule out other causes for your fatigue when determining a diagnosis. While CFS was previously a controversial diagnosis, it’s nowwidely acceptedas a medical condition. CFS can affect anyone, though it’s most common amongwomenin their40s and 50s. There’s currently no cure, but treatment can relieve symptoms. Here’s what you need to know about CFS, including symptoms, treatment options, and outlook."
234,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),What causes CFS?,"The cause of CFS is unknown. Researchers speculate that contributing factors may include: viruses aweakened immune system stress hormonal imbalances It’s also possible that some people are genetically predisposed to develop CFS. Though CFS can sometimes develop after a viral infection, no single type of infection has been found to cause CFS. Some viral infections that have been studied in relation to CFS include those caused by: Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) human herpesvirus 6 Ross River virus (RRV) rubella virus Infections caused by bacteria, includingCoxiella burnetiiandMycoplasma pneumoniae, have also been studied in relation to CFS. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)has suggested that CFS may be the end stage of multiple different conditions, rather than one specific condition. In fact, about1 in 10 peoplewith EBV, Ross River virus, orCoxiella burnetiiinfection will develop a condition that meets the criteria for a CFS diagnosis. Additionally, researchers say that those who’ve had severe symptoms with any of these three infections are at a higher risk for later developing CFS. People with CFS sometimes have weakened immune systems, but doctors don’t know whether this is enough to cause the disorder. People with CFS can also sometimes haveabnormal hormone levels. Doctors haven’t yet concluded whether this is significant, either. Some people with CFS may concomitantly have some deficiencies in vitamins including B2 (riboflavin) or B12, but it is unclear if they improve with vitamin supplementation."
235,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),Risk factors for CFS,"CFS is most commonly seen among people in their 40s and 50s. Sex also plays an important role in CFS, as women aretwo to four timesmore likely to be diagnosed with CFS than men. Other factors that may increase your risk for CFS include: genetic predisposition allergies stress environmental factors"
236,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),What are the symptoms of CFS?,"Symptoms of CFS vary based on the individual and the severity of the condition. The most common symptom is fatigue that’s severe enough to interfere with your daily activities. For CFS to be diagnosed, a significantly reduced ability to perform your usual daily activities with fatigue must last for at least 6 months. It must not be curable with bed rest. You will also experienceextreme fatigue after physical or mental activities, which is referred to as post-exertional malaise (PEM). This can last formore than 24 hoursafter the activity. CFS can also introduce sleep problems, such as: feeling unrefreshed after a night’s sleep chronic insomnia othersleep disorders In addition, you may also experience: loss of memory reducedconcentration orthostatic intolerance (going from lying or seated to standing positions makes you light-headed, dizzy, or faint) Physical symptoms of CFS may include: muscle pain frequentheadaches multi-joint pain without redness or swelling frequentsore throat tender andswollen lymph nodesin your neck and armpits CFS affects some people in cycles, with periods of feeling worse and then better. Symptoms may sometimes even disappear completely, which is referred to as remission. However, it’s still possible for symptoms to return later, which is referred to as a relapse. This cycle of remission and relapse can make it difficult to manage your symptoms, but it’s possible."
237,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),How is CFS diagnosed?,"CFS is a very challenging condition to diagnose. According to theInstitute of Medicine, as of 2015, CFS occurs in about 836,000 to 2.5 million Americans. It’s estimated, however, that 84 to 91 percent have yet to receive a diagnosis. There are no medical tests to screen for CFS. Its symptoms are similar to many other conditions. Many people with CFS don’t “look sick,” so doctors may not recognize that they indeed have a health condition. In order to receive a CFS diagnosis, your doctor will rule out other potential causes and review your medical history with you. They’ll confirm that you at least have the core symptoms previously mentioned. They’ll also ask about the duration and severity of your unexplained fatigue. Ruling out other potential causes of your fatigue is a key part of the diagnosis process. Some conditions with symptoms that resemble those of CFS include: mononucleosis Lyme disease multiple sclerosis lupus (SLE) hypothyroidism fibromyalgia major depressive disorder severe obesity sleep disorders The side effects of certain drugs, such asantihistaminesandalcohol, can mimic symptoms of CFS as well. Because of the similarities between symptoms of CFS and many other conditions, it’s important to not self-diagnose. Talk to your doctor about your symptoms. They can work with you to get relief."
238,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),How is CFS treated?,"There’s currently no specific cure for CFS. Each person has different symptoms and therefore may require different types of treatment to manage the disorder and relieve their symptoms. As mentioned above, some people with CFS may also have functional vitamin deficiencies and theoretically may feel better with vitamin supplementation but much more study is needed. Work with your team of healthcare providers to create the best treatment plan for you. They can go over the possible benefits and side effects of the therapies with you. PEM occurs when even minor physical, mental, or emotional exertion results in CFS symptoms becoming worse. Worsening symptoms usually occur12 to 48 hoursafter the activity and last for days or even weeks. Activity management, also called pacing, can help balance rest and activity to avoid PEM flare-ups. You’ll need to find your individual limits for mental and physical activities, plan these activities, and then rest to stay within these limits. Some doctors refer to staying within these limits as the “energy envelope.” Keeping a diary of your activities may help you find your personal limits. It’s important to note that while vigorous aerobic exercise is good for most chronic conditions, people with CFS don’t tolerate such exercise routines. Making somelifestyle changesmay help reduce your symptoms. Limiting or eliminating yourcaffeine intakecan help you sleep better and ease your insomnia. You should limit or avoid nicotine and alcohol too. Try to avoid napping during the day if it’s hurting your ability to sleep at night. Create asleep routine. Go to bed at the same time every night and aim to wake up around the same time every day. Typically, no one medication can treat all of your symptoms. Also, your symptoms may change over time, so your medications may have to as well. In many cases, CFS can trigger depression. You may need low-doseantidepressant therapyor a referral to a mental health provider. If lifestyle changes don’t give you a restful night’s sleep, your doctor may suggest a sleep aid. Pain-reducing medication can also help you cope with aches and joint pain caused by CFS. If medication therapy is needed, it will have to be tailored for your needs. Work closely with your doctor. There’s no one-size-fits-all treatment for CFS. Acupuncture, tai chi,yoga, and massage may help relieve the pain associated with CFS. Always talk to your doctor before beginning any alternative or complementary treatments."
239,Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS),What can be expected in the long term?,"Despite increased research efforts, CFS remains a complex condition with no exact known cause and cure. The recovery rate isonly 5%. Managing CFS can therefore be challenging. You’ll likely need to make lifestyle changes to adapt to your chronic fatigue. As a result, you may experience depression,anxiety, or social isolation. You might find that joining asupport groupcan be helpful as you’re making decisions and transitions. CFS progresses differently in everyone, so it’s important to work with your doctor to create a treatment plan that meets your needs. Many people benefit from working with a team of healthcare providers. This can include doctors, therapists, and rehabilitation specialists. If you’re living with CFS, theSolve ME/CFS Initiativehas resources that you may find helpful. TheCDCalso offers recommendations for managing and living with CFS."
240,Cocaine,Overview,"Cocaine — aka coke, blow, and snow — is a powerful stimulant made from the leaves of the coca plant. It usually comes in the form of a white, crystalline powder. While it has a few medicinal uses, personal use is illegal in the United States. If you use it, are considering using it, or are around anyone who does, read on. We’ll cover everything you need to know, like what to expect from the high, potential risks, and what to do if things go south. Healthline does not endorse the use of any illegal substances, and we recognize abstaining from them is always the safest approach. However, we believe in providing accessible and accurate information to reduce the harm that can occur when using."
241,Cocaine,How is it used?,"Cocaine is often snorted, but people also: dissolve the powder and inject it ingest it orally sprinkle it on cigarettes or joints to smoke it rub it on their gums (gumming) Some people process cocaine into a rock and smoke it, which we’ll get to next."
242,Cocaine,Is it the same thing as crack?,"Crack is cocainefreebasethat’s been processed into a rock. This makes for a more potent, smokable substance. Cocaine is made from hydrochloride and alkaloid, which is also known as base. Baking soda or ammonium is used to “free” the base by removing the hydrochloride. The end result is crack. It got its name from the crackling sound from heating and smoking the rock."
243,Cocaine,What does it feel like?,"People use coke for its intense psychologicaleffects, like euphoria and boosted confidence. But it can also produce some not-so-pleasant psychological and physical effects. Common psychological effects of cocaine include: feelings of intense happiness increased energy paranoia feeling more social and talkative inflated confidence increased alertness irritability anxiety Cocaine produces several physical effects, including: dilated pupils fast or irregular heartbeat constricted blood vessels muscle twitches tremors high blood pressure increased body temperature nausea restlessness decreased appetite insomnia headache dizziness diarrhea bloody nose trouble getting or keeping an erection"
244,Cocaine,How long do the effects take to kick in?,"Coke’s effects kick in fast, but the exact onset depends on how you consume it. Here’s thebreakdown: Snorting:1 to 3 minutes Gumming:1 to 3 minutes Smoking:10 to 15 seconds Injecting:10 to 15 seconds The reason for the time difference comes from the speed at which it enters your bloodstream. When snorted or gummed, coke needs to get through mucus, skin, and other tissues. It bypasses all that when you inject or smoke it, allowing it to enter the bloodstream almost immediately."
245,Cocaine,How long do the effects last?,"That also depends on how it’s consumed, along with other variables, like your dose and whether you’re taking other substances. Here’s what to expect in terms ofhow long the high lasts: Snorting:15 to 30 minutes Gumming:15 to 30 minutes Smoking:5 to 15 minutes Injecting:5 to 15 minutes Of course, everyone’s different, so things might last for more or less time for some folks."
246,Cocaine,Is there a comedown?,"Yes. A cocaine comedown can last as long as a few days. How much you use plays a role in how hard you crash. Once the high wears off, coke can leave you feeling depressed and extremely tired forseveral days. The short-lived high is also often followed by an intense desire to use more and difficulty sleeping."
247,Cocaine,How long does it stay in your system?,"Cocaine typically stays in your system for 1 to 4 days but can be detected for a couple of weeks in some people. Several factors can affecthow long it hangs aroundin your body, including: how much you use how often you use it how you use it the coke’s purity your body fat percentage other substances you take How long it’s detectable depends on the type ofdrug testused. Here are the general detection windows by test type: Urine:up to 4 days Blood:up to 2 days Saliva:up to 2 days Hair:up to 3 months"
248,Cocaine,Is it safe to use with alcohol?,"Cocaine and alcoholmake for a dangerous duo that can sometimes be life threatening. The combo leads to the production of a metabolite called cocaethylene, which is considerably stronger than cocaine or alcohol alone. It increases toxicity to the heart, liver, and other organs. It raises the risk of the serious effects already associated with cocaine use, including heart problems and stroke. Mixing alcohol and cocaine has also beenshownto increase cravings for each substance, leading to a higher risk of dependence."
249,Cocaine,Any other potential interactions?,"There are quite a few known interactions between cocaine and other substances, including over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications and other drugs. The most serious cocaine interactions involve: alcohol heroin opioids antipsychotics antidepressants Other potential cocaine interactions include: anticonvulsants caffeine amphetamines cannabis psychedelics, such asLSD,DMT, andshrooms dissociative drugs, such asketamine (special K),DXM, andPCP MDMA (molly, ecstasy)"
250,Cocaine,Is there a risk of addiction?,"Cocaine has high addiction potential. You can develop a tolerance to it after just a few uses. This means you need more of a substance to get the same effect you once did. The more you use it, the higher your risk for developing asubstance use disorder. The risk of addiction is even higher with crack cocaine because its effects are more immediate and more intense. Combining cocaine with alcohol and other substances also increases the risk of addiction. Signs and symptoms of acocaine addictioninclude: needing more of it to get high not being able to stop or use less withdrawal symptoms when you stop using it continuing to use it in spite of the consequences negative impact on your personal life, work life, or both spending excessive time or money on cocaine hallucinations and psychosis"
251,Cocaine,What about other risks?,"Aside from addiction, cocaine poses several other risks. Cocaine is particularly rough on the heart and cardiovascular system. Using it can increase your risk for several heart-related issues, including: high blood pressure inflammation of the heart muscle aortic dissection abnormal heart rhythms heart attack Snorting cocaine can do some serious damage to your nasal tissues. When you snort coke, the lining of your nasal passages become inflamed. Over time, this can lead to: loss of smell nosebleeds chronic rhinitis trouble swallowing Long-term or frequent use can break down tissue, causing sores. In severe cases, the septum (the cartilage between your nostrils) can develop a hole. Cocaine use carries a high risk of contracting bloodborne infections, including HIV and hepatitis C. Injecting it carries the highest risk of bloodborne infections, but you can also contract infections by smoking and snorting coke. All of these methods involve the use of a device, like a needle, pipe, or straw. Sharing any of these can introduce infection into the bloodstream through your veins, or through small cuts or sores in the mucus membranes. Injecting coke can cause skin bruising and scarring and lead to collapsed veins. Snorting can damage your mucous membranes, causing inflammation and sores in and around your nostrils. Long-term cocaine use can cause auditory and tactile hallucinations, causing you to hear and feel things that aren’t there."
252,Cocaine,Safety tips,"If you’re going to do cocaine, keep these tips in mind to reduce some of its risks: Test your coke.Cocaine is often cut with other substances, some of which can be harmful and even deadly, including fentanyl. You can purchase cocaine test kits atDanceSafe.org. Be smart about your props.Never share needles, pipes, and straws. Always inspect your devices before using. Check pipes and straws for chips or other damage. Make sure needles are sterile. Go low and slow.Stick to a low dose and avoid redosing for as long as you can. Consider only keeping a small amount accessible to you during a sesh. Don’t mix.Combining coke with other substances increases the risk of adverse interactions and fatal overdose. Don’t use coke with alcohol or any other substance. Avoid it if you have heart issues.Stay away from coke if you have high blood pressure or any other heart-related conditions. Don’t do it alone.Have someone with you in case things go south and you need help. It should be someone you trust who knows how to spot the signs of an overdose."
253,Cocaine,Recognizing an overdose,"Call 911 or your local emergency services right away if you or anyone else experiences any of the following: irregular heart rhythm or pulse trouble breathing high blood pressure hallucinations chest pain extremeagitation seizures loss of consciousness Don’t worry about law enforcement getting involved. You don’t need to mention the substances used over the phone. Just be sure to tell them about the specific symptoms so they can send the appropriate response.If you’re looking after someone else, get them into the recovery position by laying them on their side with their body supported by a bent knee. This position helps keep their airway open and can prevent choking in case they begin to vomit."
254,Cocaine,If you’re looking for help,"If you’re worried about your cocaine use and want help, you have options. Consider talking to your primary healthcare provider if you’re comfortable doing so. Patient confidentiality laws prevent them from sharing this information with law enforcement.

255,Common Cold,Overview,"The common cold is a viral infection that affects your upper respiratory tract. The most common cause is a rhinovirus, and the most common symptoms are a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, and a scratchy, sore throat. The first signs of the common cold are fairly obvious: a stuffy or runny nose, sneezing, and a scratchy, sore throat. Most people quickly recognize these early symptoms because the common cold is so ordinary. In fact, adults have an average oftwo to three coldsper year. The common cold is actually a viral infection in your upper respiratory tract. More than 200 viruses can cause a cold. Rhinoviruses are the most common causes. These viruses are easily spread from person to person or surface to surface. Many of them can live on surfaces for hours or even days. While you might be familiar with the common cold, there are some things to know about this condition that can help you feel better, avoid future colds, and reduce the spread of a virus. Read on to learn how to cope with the common cold."
256,Common Cold,What are the symptoms of a cold?,"Once you‘re exposed to a virus that can cause a cold, symptoms typically take1 to 3 daysto appear. The symptoms of a cold rarely appear suddenly after exposure. Nasal symptoms include: sinus pressure runny nose stuffy nose loss of smell or taste sneezing postnasal drip(drainage in the back of your throat) Head symptoms include: watery eyes headache sore throat swollen lymph nodes Chest symptoms include: chest discomfort difficulty breathing deeply cough Whole body symptoms include: fatigue(general tiredness) chills body aches feverbelow 102.2°F (39°C) Symptoms of a cold tend to peak on day 2 or 3 and then gradually improve, and they typically clear up within7 to 10 days. If your symptoms worsen after a week or haven’t disappeared after about10 days, you might have another condition, and it may be time to consult a doctor."
257,Common Cold,What’s the difference between a cold and the flu?,"The common cold and theflumay seem very similar at first. They are indeed both respiratory conditions and can cause similar symptoms. But different viruses cause each condition. Your symptoms will help you distinguish between the two. Knowing the difference between cold and flu symptoms can help you decide how to treat your condition — and whether you need to contact a doctor. As a rule,flu symptomsare more severe than cold symptoms. The two conditions also differ distinctly in severity. Colds rarely cause additional health conditions or problems, but the flu can lead tocomplicationssuch as: sinus andear infections pneumonia sepsis"
258,Common Cold,Diagnosing a cold,"Diagnosing an uncomplicated cold rarely requires a trip to a doctor’s office. Recognizing the symptoms of a cold is often all you need to figure out your diagnosis. But if your symptoms worsen or last longer than 10 days, it’s a good idea to make an appointment with a doctor. You might be dealing with a different health condition, which your doctor will be able to diagnose. If you have a cold, you can expect the virus to work its way out of your system within 10 days. If your doctor diagnoses a cold, you’ll likely need to treat your symptoms only until the virus has run its course. Treatment may involve using over-the-counter (OTC) cold medications, staying hydrated, and getting plenty of rest. If you have the flu, the virus may take the same amount of time as a cold to fully disappear. But if you notice that your symptoms are getting worse after day 5 or if you don’t start feeling better after a week, it’s a good idea to follow up with your doctor, as you may have developed another condition. If you have the flu, you might benefit from taking anantiviral flu medicationearly in the cycle of the virus. Rest and hydration are also very beneficial when you have the flu. Much like the common cold, the flu just needs time to work its way through your body."
259,Common Cold,Treatment for adults,"The common cold is a viral infection in your upper respiratory tract. Viruses cannot be treated with antibiotics. In most cases, viruses like the cold just need to run their course. You can treat the symptoms of the infection, but you can’t treat the infection itself. Cold treatments generally fall into two main categories: OTC medications and home remedies. The most common OTC medications used for colds include: Decongestants:Decongestantmedications help ease nasal congestion and stuffiness. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)does not recommendthe use of decongestants in children under 12 years old. Antihistamines:Antihistamineshelp prevent sneezing and ease runny nose symptoms. The AAP does not recommend antihistamines for children under 6 years old. Pain relievers:Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)such asibuprofen (Advil, Motrin),naproxen (Aleve), andaspirincan help reduce body aches, inflammation, and fever symptoms. Common cold medicationssometimes include a combination of these drug types. If you’re using one, be sure to read the label and understand what you’re taking so you don’t accidentally take more than you should of any one class of drug. The most common side effects from OTC cold medications include: dizziness dehydration dry mouth drowsiness nausea headache If you’ve previously received a diagnosis ofhigh blood pressure, you should consult your doctor before using any OTC cold medications. Certain medications help relieve symptoms by narrowing your blood vessels and reducing blood flow. If you have high blood pressure, this may affect blood flow throughout your body. Like OTC cold remedies, home remedies for the common cold don’t cure or treat a cold. Instead, they can help make your symptoms less severe and easier to manage. The most effective and common home remedies for a cold include: Gargling with salt water:Asalt water garglecan coat your throat and ease irritation. Drinking plenty of fluids:Staying well hydrated helps you replace fluids you’ve lost and helps relieve congestion. Using vapor rub:Vapor rubtopical ointments help open your airways and ease congestion. Getting lots of rest:Getting plenty of rest helps your body save energy to let the virus run its course. Using zinc lozenges:Zinc lozengesmay shorten the duration of cold symptoms if you take them at the very start of your symptoms. Taking echinacea:A2018 research reviewsuggests thatechinaceamay be effective at shortening the duration of a cold in some cases. But talk with a doctor before giving echinacea to kids under 12 years old."
260,Common Cold,Treatment for children,"TheFood and Drug Administration (FDA)does not recommend OTC medications for cough and cold symptoms in children under 2 years old because these medications could cause serious and potentially life threatening side effects. Manufacturers voluntarily label these cough and cold products with the warning “Do not use in children under 4 years of age.” Additionally, the FDA does not recommend the use of homeopathic remedies in children under 4 years old, since these products are not FDA approved and may cause serious side effects. You may be able to reduce achild’s cold symptomswith these home remedies: Rest:Children who have a cold may be more tired and irritable than usual. If possible, let them stay home from school and rest until the cold has cleared. Hydration:It’s very important for a child who has a cold to get plenty of fluids. Colds can dehydrate a child quickly. Make sure they’re drinking regularly. Water is a great option. Warm drinks such as tea can pull double duty by soothing a sore throat. Food:Kids with a cold may not feel as hungry as usual, so look for ways to give them calories and fluids. Smoothies and soups are two good options. Salt water gargles:It may not be the most pleasant experience, but gargling with warm, salty water can help soothe a sore throat. Saline nasal sprays can help clear up nasal congestion. Warm baths:A warm bath may ease mild aches and pains that are common with a cold. A cool mist humidifier:A cool mist humidifier canhelp decreasenasal congestion. Do not use a warm mist humidifier because it can cause swelling in the nasal passages, making breathing more difficult. A bulb syringe:Nasal suctioning with a bulb syringe works well to clear babies’ nasal passages. Older children typically resist bulb syringes."
261,Common Cold,How long does a cold last?,"Symptoms of a cold typically clear up within10 days, but they can lastas long as 2 weeks. Depending on your overall health, you may have symptoms for more or less time. For example, people who smoke or have asthma may experience symptoms for longer. If your symptoms don’t decrease or disappear within 7 to 10 days, make an appointment with a doctor. If your symptoms begin worsening after 5 days, it’s also important to contact a doctor. Symptoms that get worse or don’t go away could be a sign of another health condition, such as the flu orstrep throat."
262,Common Cold,What food should you eat if you have a cold?,"When you’re sick, you might not feel like eating at all, but your body still needs the energy that food provides. The following foods may be extra helpful for your cold recovery: The salty soup is a classic “treatment” for all kinds of health conditions. It’s especially great for colds. Warm liquids can help open up your sinuses so you can breathe more easily, and the salt from the soup can ease irritated throat tissue. Warm drinks liketeaare great for colds. You can add honey for a cough-busting boost. Slices of ginger may helpreduce inflammation. And inhaling the steam from hot tea might helpease congestion. Try to stay away from coffee, though. Caffeine can interfere with medications and may increase your risk of dehydration. Yogurtcontains billions of healthy bacteria that can boost your gut health. Having a healthy gut microbiome may help your body fight a variety of conditions, including a cold. Like hot tea, ice pops may help numb and ease the pain of a sore throat. Look for low sugar varieties or make your own “smoothie” pop with yogurt, fruit, and natural juices. The most important thing to remember when you have a cold is to stay hydrated. Drink water or warm tea regularly. And avoid caffeine and alcohol while you’re recovering from a cold — both can make your cold symptoms worse."
263,Common Cold,Risk factors for the common cold,"The following factors may increase your risk of catching a cold: Cooler seasons:Colds can happen any time of year, but they’remore commonin the fall and winter and during rainy seasons. We spend more time inside when it’s cold and wet, which increases the chances that viruses will spread. Younger age:Children under 6 years old are more likely to develop colds. Their risk is even higher if they spend time in a child care setting with other kids. Crowded environments:In places where you’re around a lot of people, such as on a plane or at a concert, you’re more likely to encounter rhinoviruses. Weakened immune system:If you have a chronic health condition or have been sick recently, you may be more likely to contract a cold virus. Smoking:People who smoke have an increased risk of catching a cold, and their colds tend to be more severe. Lack of sleep:Irregular or inadequate sleep canaffectyour immune system, which may make you more susceptible to cold viruses."
264,Common Cold,How to protect yourself from a cold,"A cold is usually a minor condition, but it can be inconvenient and can certainly make you feel miserable. You can’t get a vaccine to prevent colds like you can for the flu. But you can take a few key steps during cold season to reduce your chances of picking up a cold virus. Wash your hands:Washing your handswith soap and water is the best way to stop the spread of germs. Use alcohol-based hand sanitizer gels and sprays as a last resort when you can’t get to a sink. Avoid close contact with those who are sick:Germs can spread easily in offices and classrooms, which is why people should try tostay home from work or schoolwhen sick. If you notice that someone isn’t feeling well, try not to get too close to them. And be sure to wash your hands if you do. Take care of your gut:Eat plenty of bacteria-rich foods, such as yogurt, or take a dailyprobiotic supplement. Keeping yourgut bacteriahealthy can help boost your overall health. Avoid touching your face:Cold viruses can live on your body without making you sick. But if you touch your mouth, nose, or eyes while the virus is present on your hands, you’ll likely get sick. Avoid touching your face or wash your hands before doing so."
265,Common Cold,How to protect others,"When someone contracts a cold-causing virus, it can spread to others through the air, on surfaces, and through close physical contact. People who are carrying the virus can also leave it behind on shared surfaces such as doorknobs and computers. If you have a cold, it’s important to be a good neighbor, family member, or friend and take steps to protect those around you when possible. Wash your hands:Washing your hands protects you, but it also protects others. When you wash your hands, you reduce the risk of spreading the virus elsewhere in your home, school, or workplace. Stay at home:If you or your child is sick, stay home if possible. You need the rest, and staying home can help reduce the spread of the virus. Avoid close contact:While it may be tempting to show love to another person, it’s best for their health that you avoid hugging, kissing, or shaking hands while you’re sick. If you must greet someone, try an elbow bump. Cough into your elbow:If you feel a sneeze or cough coming on, grab a tissue to cover it. If you don’t have one, sneeze or coughinto your elbow, not your hands. If you accidentally use your hands, wash them immediately. Disinfect regularly:If you or someone else in your home is sick, pick up a container of disinfecting wipes andfrequently cleanall high-touch surfaces, such as doorknobs, kitchen counters, appliances, and remotes."
266,Common Cold,When to contact a doctor,"Most cold viruses will work their way through your body in 7 to 10 days. Symptoms are usually at their worst 2 to 3 days after you first notice them. As uncomfortable as a cold may be, OTC medications and home remedies are typically the best way to deal with an uncomplicated cold. However, in some cases, you might need to contact a doctor about your cold symptoms. Consider getting medical attention in the following situations: Severe or worsening symptoms:If your symptoms (such as a cough or headaches) seem more severe than they usually are when you have a cold, it’s time to see a doctor. Persistent symptoms:If cold symptoms last more than 10 days, make an appointment with a doctor. Difficulty breathing:If you have shortness of breath or find it hard to breathe, get care right away. A high or persistent fever:Contact a doctor if you or your child has a fever of101°F (38°C)or higher or any fever that lasts longer than4 days. Symptoms in a child under 3 months old:If an infant is showing signs of a cold, such as lethargy or a fever of any kind, consult a doctor immediately. Persistent symptoms in anyone with high risk:If you’re in a high risk group and have a persistent cold, you should see a doctor. If your cold turns out to be a more serious condition, you could be at risk of complications. High risk groups include:children under 5 years oldadults 65 years old and olderpregnant peoplepeople with medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease children under 5 years old adults 65 years old and older pregnant people people with medical conditions such as asthma, diabetes, and heart disease"
267,Common Cold,The bottom line,"The common cold is precisely that — common. In fact, adults experience an average of two to three colds per year. That means most people know they have a cold as soon as the symptoms start. Colds can be quite uncomfortable. Symptoms such as a runny or stuffy nose, headache, cough, and loss of smell or taste can make for a miserable few days. But after 7 to 10 days, most people will start to feel better. There are no cures or treatments that will end a cold. The cold is a virus that has to run its course until it’s gone. But you can treat the symptoms of a common cold. OTC medications can ease congestion or sneezing. Home remedies such as salt water gargles can ease a sore throat. And rest and hydration can help your body recover from a cold. Sometimes symptoms that seem like a cold might actually be caused by another upper respiratory infection, such as the flu. If your symptoms seem more severe than usual or don’t ease after a week, make an appointment with a doctor."
268,Constipation,Overview,"Constipation means having hard, dry bowel movements or passing stool fewer than three times a week. It can be caused by things like your diet, medications, whether you are pregnant, or just a change in your routine. Constipation is one of the most common digestive problems in the United States. Around16 out of 100 U.S. adultshave constipation. This figure doubles for adults over age 60. Read on to learn the symptoms and causes of constipation, and how it can be treated."
269,Constipation,Symptoms,"Each person’s bowel habits are different. Some people go three times a day, while others go three times a week. However, you maybe constipatedif you experience the following symptoms: fewer than three bowel movements a week passing lumpy,hard, or dry stools straining orpain during bowel movements a feeling of fullness, even after having a bowel movement TheNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK)recommends seeking medical advice if symptoms don’t go away or if you notice the following: bleeding from the rectum blood in your stool persistentabdominal pain pain in the lower back a feeling that gas is trapped vomiting fever unexplained weight loss a sudden change in bowel movements A healthcare professional may carry out tests to rule out a more serious condition, such as colorectal cancer orirritable bowel syndrome (IBS)."
270,Constipation,Causes,"Your colon’s main job is to absorb water from residual food as it’s passing through your digestive system. It then creates stool (waste). The colon’s muscles eventually propel the waste out through the rectum to be eliminated. If stool remains in the colon too long, it can become hard and difficult to pass. Poor diet frequently causes constipation. Dietary fiber andadequate water intakeare necessary to help keep stools soft. Fiber-rich foods are usually plant-based. Fiber comes insoluble and insoluble forms. Soluble fiber can dissolve in water and creates a soft, gel-like material as it passes through the digestive system. Insoluble fiber retains most of its structure as it goes through the digestive system. Both forms of fiber join with stool, increasing its weight and size while also softening it. This makes it easier to pass through the rectum. Stress, changes in routine, and conditions that slow muscle contractions of the colon or delay your urge to go may also lead to constipation. Common causes of constipation include: low fiber diet, particularly diets high in meat, milk, or cheese dehydration low exercise levels delaying the impulse to have a bowel movement travel or other changes in routine medications, including certainantacids, pain medications, diuretics, and some treatments for Parkinson’s disease pregnancy older age (constipation affects aroundone-thirdof people ages 60 and over) The following underlying health conditions can bring on constipation: certain conditions, such asstroke,Parkinson’s disease, anddiabetes problems with the colon or rectum, includingintestinal obstruction, IBS, or diverticulosis overuse or misuse oflaxatives hormonal problems, including anunderactive thyroid gland"
271,Constipation,Relief and treatment,"Changing your diet and increasing your physical activity level are the easiest and fastest ways to treat and prevent constipation. You can try the following techniques as well: Every day, drink 1.5 to 2 quarts of unsweetened fluids, like water, to hydrate the body. Limitconsumption of alcoholand caffeinated drinks, which cause dehydration. Addfiber-rich foodsto your diet, such as raw fruits and vegetables, whole grains, beans, prunes, or bran cereal. Your daily intake of fiber should be between 20 and 35 grams. Cut down on low fiber foods, such as meat, milk, cheese, and processed foods. Aim for about150 minutes of moderate exercise every week, with a goal of 30 minutes per day at least five times per week. Try walking, swimming, or biking. If you feel the urge to have a bowel movement, don’t delay. The longer you wait, the harder your stool can become. Ask your doctor about bowel training to get your body used to passing stool15 to 45 minutesafter breakfast each day. Raise your knees by putting your feet on a footstool when having a bowel movement. When using the bathroom, allow yourself plenty of time, and try to relax your muscles. Use laxatives sparingly. A healthcare professional may prescribe laxatives or enemas for a short period of time to help soften your stools. Never use laxatives for more than 2 weeks without talking with a healthcare professional. Your body can develop a dependence on them. Ask a healthcare professional if any of your medications might be causing constipation. Ifhome remediesdo not work, a healthcare professional may recommend an over-the-counterlaxative, such as: fiber supplements osmotic agents, such asMilk of Magnesia stool softeners lubricants, such asmineral oil stimulants If you still have trouble with constipation, a healthcare professional may prescribe medications to help, such as: lubiprostone, which increases fluid levels in the intestine linaclotide or plecanatide, which can help make bowel movements more regular for people with long-term constipation or IBS prucalopride, which can help the colon move the stool along A healthcare professional may also advise that you stop taking certain medications that may cause constipation. Other strategies that may help are: biofeedback therapy, which can help a person retrain their muscles an enema a procedure to manually remove feces to provide relief surgery to remove a blockage long-term treatment for a chronic condition, such as IBS"
272,Constipation,How to prevent constipation,"Tips for preventing constipation are similar to those for relieving it. Try the following: Eat plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Eat high fiber foods and ask a healthcare professional about usingfiber supplements. Include prunes or bran cereal in your diet. Drink plenty of water. Avoid alcohol and caffeine, as they can lead to dehydration. Get regular exercise. Consider addingprobioticsto your diet, like those found in yogurt and kefir with live active cultures. Train your muscles to have a bowel movement at the same time each day. Somestudieshave shown that adding probiotics can be helpful for people withchronic constipation. If you add fiber supplements, remember to drink plenty of fluids. Fluids help fiber work more efficiently."
273,Constipation,How is constipation diagnosed?,"If constipation persists, or if you have concerns about your symptoms, it may be time to see a healthcare professional. A healthcare professional: will ask questions about your symptoms, medical history, and any medications or underlying conditions may carry out a physical examination, including arectal exam may do someblood teststo check yourblood count, electrolytes, and thyroid function They may recommend additional tests to identify the cause of your symptoms. Tests may include the following: A marker study, also called a colorectal transit study, is used to test how food is moving through your colon. For this test, you’ll swallow a pill that contains tiny markers that will show up on an X-ray. Numerousabdominal X-rayswill be taken over the next few days so the healthcare professional can visualize how the food is moving through your colon and how well your intestinal muscles are working. You may also be asked to eat adiet high in fiberduring the test. An anorectal manometry is a test used to evaluate anal sphincter muscle function. For this test, a healthcare professional will insert a thin tube with a balloon tip into your anus. When the tube is inside, they will inflate the balloon and slowly pull it out. This test allows them to measure your anal sphincter’s muscle strength and see whether your muscles are contracting properly. Abarium enema X-rayis a type of test used to examine the colon. For this test, you’ll drink a special liquid the night before the test to clean out the bowel. The actual test involves the insertion of a dye called barium into your rectum, using a lubricated tube. The barium highlights the rectum and colon area. This allows the healthcare professional to better view these areas on an X-ray. A colonoscopy is another type of test healthcare professionals use to examine the colon. In this test, a healthcare professional will examine your colon using a colonoscope. This is a tube fitted with a camera and light source. A sedative and pain medication is often given, so you’ll likely not even remember the examination and should feel no pain. To prepare for this test, you’ll be on a liquid-only diet for 1 to 3 days. You may have to take a laxative or enema the night before the test to clean out the bowel."
274,Constipation,Takeaway,"Constipation is a common problem that affects people as they get older, when they use certain medications, or if they don’t have much fiber in their diet. Most cases of constipation are mild and easily treated with changes in diet and exercise. If you’re experiencing chronic constipation or constipation along with other bowel changes, it’s important that you talk with a healthcare professional."
275,COPD,Overview,"COPD is a group of progressive lung diseases that includes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Despite affecting an estimated 32 million people in the United States, as many as half are unaware they have it. The main symptoms include shortness of breath, wheezing, chest tightness, chronic cough with or without mucus, frequent respiratory infections, and lack of energy, which typically start mild but worsen over time. Most people with COPD in the United States are at least 40 years old and have a history of smoking, making smoking cessation a critical part of treatment along with medications, oxygen therapy, and lifestyle changes Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, commonly referred to as COPD, is a group of progressive lung diseases. An estimated32 millionpeople in the United States have COPD. As many as half are unaware that they have it. These diseases include emphysema and chronic bronchitis. Many people with COPD have both. Emphysema slowly destroys air sacs in your lungs, interfering with blood flow. Bronchitis causes inflammation and narrowing of the bronchial tubes, which allows mucus to build up. Untreated COPD can lead to a faster progression of the disease, heart problems, and worsening respiratory infections. Keep reading to learn about the symptoms, causes, and how doctors treat COPD."
276,COPD,What are the symptoms of COPD?,"COPD makes it harder to breathe. Symptoms may be mild at first, and you might have shortness of breath. As it progresses, symptoms can become more constant to the point where it can become increasingly difficult to breathe. You may experience wheezing and tightness in the chest or have excess sputum (saliva and mucus) production. Some people with COPDhave acute exacerbations, which are flare-ups of severe symptoms. At first, symptoms of COPD can be quite mild. You might mistake them for a cold. Early symptoms include: occasionalshortness of breath, especially after exercise mild but recurrent cough needing to clear your throat often, especially first thing in the morning You might start making subtle changes, such as avoiding stairs and skipping physical activities. Symptoms can get progressively worse over time and usually become harder to ignore. As the lungs become more damaged, you may experience: shortness of breath after mild forms of exercise, like walking up a flight of stairs wheezing, which is a type of higher-pitched, noisy breathing, especially during exhalation chest tightness chronic cough, with or without mucus the need to clear mucus from your lungs every day frequent colds, flu, or other respiratory infections lack of energy In later stages of COPD, symptoms may also include: fatigue swelling of the feet, ankles, or legs weight loss If you smoke or vape, your symptoms may be worse. Learn more about the symptoms of COPD. Immediate medical care is needed if: you have bluish or gray fingernails or lips, as this indicates low oxygen levels in your blood you have trouble catching your breath or can’t talk you feel confused, muddled, or faint your heart is racing"
277,COPD,What are the stages of COPD?,"There are different grading systems, and one grading system is part of theGOLD classification. The GOLD classification is used to determine COPD severity and help form a treatment plan. There are four GOLD grades based on spirometry testing: Grade 1:mild Grade 2:moderate Grade 3:severe Grade 4:very severe This is based on thespirometrytest result of your FEV1. This is the amount of air you can breathe out of the lungs in the first second of a forced expiration. The lower your FEV1, the more severe the condition. The GOLD classification also considers your individual symptoms and history of acute exacerbations. As the disease progresses, you’re more susceptible to complications, such as: respiratory infections, including common colds, flu, and pneumonia heart problems high blood pressure in lung arteries (pulmonary hypertension) lung cancer depression and anxiety"
278,COPD,What causes COPD?,"Most people with COPD in the United States are at least 40 years old and have at least some history of smoking. The longer and more tobacco products you smoke, thegreater your riskfor COPD. In addition to cigarette smoke, cigar smoke, pipe smoke, and secondhand smoke can cause COPD. Your risk of COPD is even greater if you have asthma and smoke. You can also develop COPD if you’re exposed to chemicals and fumes in the workplace. Long-term exposure to air pollution and inhaling dust can also cause COPD. In some countries, homes may be poorly ventilated. As a result, families may breathe fumes from burning fuel used for cooking and heating. This can also cause COPD. A genetic mutation, known asalpha-1 antitrypsin (AATD) deficiency, can also increase a person’s risk of COPD."
279,COPD,Diagnosing COPD,"There is no single test for COPD. The diagnosis is based on symptoms, a physical exam, and diagnostic test results. When you visit the doctor, it may help to bring a list of your symptoms and when and how often they occur. Be sure to let your doctor know if you: smoke or have smoked in the past have or had exposure to lung irritants on the job or elsewhere have exposure to a lot of secondhand smoke have a family history of COPD have asthma or other respiratory conditions take over-the-counter (OTC) or prescription medications During the physical exam, a doctor uses a stethoscope to listen to your lungs as you breathe. Based on this information, your doctor may order additional tests to get a more complete picture: Pulmonary function testing:This type of testing may includespirometry,assessment of lung volumes, and assessment of diffusing capacity. These are noninvasive tests to assess overall lung function. During the test, you’ll take a deep breath and blow into a tube connected to the spirometer. Imaging tests:Your doctor may order a chestX-rayorCT scan. These images can provide a detailed look at your lungs, blood vessels, and heart. Arterial blood gas test:This involves taking a blood sample from an artery to measure your blood oxygen, carbon dioxide, and other important levels. These tests can help determine if you have COPD or a different condition, such asasthma, a restrictive lung disease, orheart failure."
280,COPD,Medications for COPD,"Medications for COPDcan reduce symptoms and cut down on flare-ups. Finding the medication and dosage that works best for you may take some trial and error. Medicines called bronchodilators help loosen tight muscles in your airways. They’re typically taken through an inhaler or nebulizer. Short-acting bronchodilators last 4 to 6 hours and you only use them when needed. For ongoing symptoms, long-acting versions can be used daily and last about 12 hours. For people with COPD who experience shortness of breath or trouble breathing during exercise, theAmerican Thoracic Societystrongly recommends a long-acting beta-agonist (LABA) combined with a long-acting muscarinic antagonist (LAMA). These bronchodilators work by relaxing tightened muscles in the airways, widening them for better air passage and helping the body clear mucus from the lungs. These two types of bronchodilators can be taken in combination via an inhaler or with anebulizer.Here’s a list of recommended LABA/LAMA bronchodilator therapies: aclidinium/formoterol glycopyrrolate/formoterol tiotropium/olodaterol umeclidinium/vilanterol Long-acting bronchodilators may be combined with inhaled glucocorticosteroids, but the currentGOLD guidelinescall for minimizing the use of inhaled corticosteroids in COPD treatment. Doctors may recommend their limited use and other treatments for people with severe symptoms and frequent exacerbations. A glucocorticosteroid can reduce inflammation in the airways and lower mucus production. The long-acting bronchodilator can relax the airway muscle to help the airways stay wider. Corticosteroids are also available in pill form. This type of medication can be taken in pill form to help reduce inflammation and relax the airways. The GOLD guidelines for COPD management recommend phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitors as an add-on therapy for people with persistent COPD symptoms and exacerbations despite treatment with bronchodilators and inhaled corticosteroids. Doctors generally prescribe it for severe COPD withchronic bronchitisand a history of exacerbations. This medication comes in pill form. It eases chest tightness and shortness of breath and may also help prevent COPD flare-ups. Theophylline (Theo-24, Elixophylline, Theochron) is an older medication that relaxes the airway muscles. Because it may cause side effects, it’s generally not a first-line treatment for COPD therapy. Doctors may prescribe antibiotics or antivirals if you develop certain respiratory infections to help you recover."
281,COPD,Other parts of treatment for COPD,"Treatment can ease symptoms, prevent complications, and generally slow disease progression. Your healthcare team may include a lung specialist (pulmonologist) and physical and respiratory therapists. To lower the risk of other respiratory infections, your doctor may recommend certain vaccines, including: a yearly flu shot a COVID-19 vaccine booster thepneumococcal vaccine atetanus boosterthat includes protection frompertussis(whooping cough) If your blood oxygen level is too low, you can receivesupplemental oxygenthrough a mask or nasal cannula to help you breathe better. A portable unit can make it easier to get around. Surgery is reserved for severe COPD or when other treatments haven’t worked. These can include: Bullectomy:Duringthis procedure, surgeons remove large, abnormal air spaces (bullae) from the lungs. Lung volume reduction surgery:This surgery removes damaged upper lung tissue and can be effective at improving breathing, but may have risks. Lung transplantation:This may be an option for some people. Althoughlung transplantationcan effectively cure COPD, it has many risks. Endobronchial valves (EBV):This is a less invasive method of improving airflow efficiency in people with severe emphysema. These one-way valves divert inspired air to healthy lungs and away from non-functioning, damaged lungs. In 2018, an EBV device called theZephyr Endobronchial Valvewas approved by the FDA and has been shown to improve lung function, exercise capacity, and quality of life for people living with severe emphysema."
282,COPD,Lifestyle changes for COPD management,"COPD requires lifelong management. That means following the advice of your healthcare team and maintaining healthy lifestyle habits. Since your lungs are weaker, you’ll want to avoid anything that might overtax them or cause a flare-up. Here’s a list of things to consider as you adjust your lifestyle. Avoiding smoking:If you’re having trouble quitting, speak with your doctor about smoking cessation programs. Try to avoid secondhand smoke, chemical fumes, air pollution, and dust. Staying active:A little exercise each day can support your overall health and your heart and lung function. It’s best to speak with your doctor about how much exercise they recommend for you before drastically changing your exercise routine. Eating a diet of nutritious foods:Avoiding highly processed foods high in calories and salt but low in nutrients may help support your health. Treating other conditions:If you have other chronic health conditions along with COPD, it’s important to manage those as well, particularly type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Cleaning your home:It can help to clear the clutter and streamline your home, so it takes less energy to clean and do other household tasks. If you have advanced COPD, you may need help with daily chores. Being prepared for flare-ups:Make sure to carry your emergency contact information with you and post it on your refrigerator. Include information about what medications you take, as well as the doses. Keep emergency numbers stored on your phone. Finding support:Talking to others who understand can be a relief. Consider joining a support group. The COPD Foundation provides a comprehensive list oforganizations and resourcesfor people living with COPD."
283,COPD,Diet recommendations for people with COPD,"There’s no specificdiet for COPD, but a healthy diet is important for maintaining overall health. The healthier you are, the more you’ll be able to help prevent complications and other health problems. Consider eating a variety of nutritious foods from these groups: vegetables fruits grains protein dairy Avoiding or limiting salt may also help, as salt causes the body to retain water, which can strain breathing."
284,COPD,Is there a connection between COPD and lung cancer?,"COPD andlung cancerare linked in several ways. COPD andlung cancerhave multiple common risk factors. Smoking is the top risk factor for both diseases. Both are also more likely if you breathe secondhand smoke or are exposed to chemicals or other fumes in the workplace. There may be a genetic predisposition to developing both diseases. Also, the risk of developing either COPD or lung cancer increases with age. In some cases, people don’t learn they have COPD until they receive a diagnosis of lung cancer. Having COPD doesn’t necessarily mean you’ll get lung cancer. However, it does mean that you have a higher risk. That’s another reason why, if you smoke, quitting is a good idea."
285,COPD,COPD statistics,About16 millionadults in the United States have a diagnosis of COPD. Most people with COPD are40 years of ageor older and have a history of smoking. COPD is thethird leadingcause of death in the United States. More females than males die from COPD each year.
286,COPD,What’s the outlook for people with COPD?,"COPD generally reduces life expectancy, though the outlook varies considerably from person to person. People with COPD who never smoked may have a modest reduction in theirlife expectancy, while former and current smokers are likely to have a larger reduction. However, your individual life expectancy can depend on other factors, including your overall health and the extent of lung damage. Once you have a diagnosis, you’ll need to start seeing your doctor regularly. You’ll also need to take steps to manage your condition and make the appropriate changes to your daily life. Treatment and lifestyle changes can help manage early symptoms of COPD and help you maintain a good quality of life for some time. People with severe stages of COPD may not be able to care for themselves without assistance. COPD increases the risk of developing certain health conditions, including: respiratory infections heart problems lung cancer depression anxiety Besides smoking, your outlook depends on how well you respond to treatment and whether you can avoid serious complications. Your doctor is in the best position to evaluate your overall health and give you an idea about what to expect. Read this article in Spanish."
287,Coronary Artery Disease,Overview,"Coronary artery disease is the most common form of heart disease. It happens when something, like plaque buildup, reduces blood flow to the heart. It can increase your risk of heart attack. Coronary artery disease (CAD) causes impaired blood flow in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. Also called coronary heart disease (CHD), CAD is the most common form ofheart diseaseand affects approximately16.5 millionAmericans over the age of 20. It’s also theleading cause of deathfor both men and women in the United States. It’s estimated that every36 seconds, someone in the United States has a heart attack. Aheart attackcan come from uncontrolled CAD."
288,Coronary Artery Disease,Coronary artery disease symptoms,"When your heart doesn’t get enough arterial blood, you may experience a variety of symptoms.Angina(chest discomfort) is the most common symptom of CAD. Some people describe this discomfort as: chest pain heaviness tightness burning squeezing These symptoms can also be mistaken forheartburnorindigestion. Other symptoms of CAD include: pain in thearmsorshoulders shortness of breath sweating dizziness You may experiencemore symptomswhen your blood flow is more restricted. If a blockage cuts off blood flow completely or almost completely, your heart muscle will start to die if not restored. This is a heart attack. Don’t ignore any of these symptoms, especially if they are excruciating or last longer than five minutes. Immediate medical treatment is necessary. Women may also experience the above symptoms, but they’re also more likely to have: nausea vomiting back pain jaw pain shortness of breath without feeling chest pain Men have ahigher riskof developing heart disease than women, however. Due to decreased blood flow, your heart may also: become weak develop abnormal heart rhythms (arrhythmia) or rates fail to pump as much blood as your body needs Your doctor will detect these heart abnormalities during diagnosis."
289,Coronary Artery Disease,Causes of coronary artery disease,"The most common cause of CAD is a vascular injury with cholesterol plaque buildup in the arteries, known asatherosclerosis. Reduced blood flow occurs when one or more of these arteries becomes partially or completely blocked. Other rare causesof damage or blockage to a coronary artery also limit blood flow to the heart."
290,Coronary Artery Disease,Coronary artery disease risk factors,"Understanding therisk factorsfor CAD can help with your plan to prevent or decrease the likelihood of developing the disease. Risk factors include: high blood pressure high blood cholesterol levels tobaccosmoking insulin resistance/hyperglycemia/diabetesmellitus obesity inactivity unhealthy eating habits obstructive sleep apnea emotional stress excessive alcohol consumption history ofpreeclampsiaduring pregnancy The risk for CAD also increases with age. Based on age alone as a risk factor, men have a greater risk for the disease beginning atage 45and women have a greater risk beginning atage 55. The risk for coronary artery disease is also higher if you have a family history of the disease."
291,Coronary Artery Disease,Coronary artery disease diagnosis,"Diagnosing CADrequires a review of your medical history, a physical examination, and other medical testing. These tests include: Electrocardiogram:This test monitors electrical signals that travel through your heart. It may help your doctor determine whether you’ve had a heart attack. Echocardiogram:This imaging test uses ultrasound waves to create a picture of your heart. The results of this test reveal whether certain things in your heart are functioning properly. Stress test:This particular test measures the stress on your heart during physical activity and while at rest. The test monitors your heart’s electrical activity while you walk on a treadmill or ride a stationary bike. Nuclear imaging or echocardiographic imaging may also be performed for a portion of this test. For those unable to perform physical exercise, certain medications can be used instead for stress testing. Cardiac catheterization (left heart catheterization):During this procedure, your doctor injects a special dye into your coronary arteries through a catheter inserted through an artery in your groin or wrist. The dye helps enhance the radiographic image of your coronary arteries to identify any blockages. Heart CT scan:Your doctor may use this imaging test to check for calcium deposits in your arteries."
292,Coronary Artery Disease,Coronary artery disease anatomy,"The four primary coronary arteries are located on the surface of the heart: right main coronary artery left main coronary artery left circumflex artery left anterior descending artery These arteries bring oxygen and nutrient-rich blood to yourheart. Your heart is a muscle that’s responsible for pumping blood throughout your body and needs oxygen all the time. Ahealthy heartmoves approximately 3,000 gallons of blood through your body every day. Like any other organ or muscle, your heart must receive an adequate, dependable supply of blood in order to carry out its work. Reduced blood flow to your heart can cause symptoms of CAD."
293,Coronary Artery Disease,What is the treatment for CAD?,"It’s important to reduce or control your risk factors and seek treatment to lower the chance of a heart attack or stroke if you’re diagnosed with CAD. Treatmentalso depends on your current health condition, risk factors, and overall wellbeing. For example, your doctor may prescribe medication therapy to treat high cholesterol or high blood pressure, or you may receive medication to control blood sugar if you have diabetes. Medications are the most common treatment for CAD. Learn more here. Lifestyle changes can also reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke. For example: quit smoking tobacco reduce or stop your consumption of alcohol exercise regularly lose weight to a healthy level eat ahealthy diet(low in saturated fat, sodium, and added sugar) If your condition doesn’t improve with lifestyle changes and medication, your doctor may recommend a procedure to increase blood flow to your heart. These procedures may be: balloon angioplasty:to widen blocked arteries and smoosh down the plaque buildup, usually performed with insertion of a stent to help keep the lumen open after the procedure coronary artery bypass graft surgery:to restore blood flow to the heart in open chest surgery enhanced external counterpulsation:to stimulate the formation of new small blood vessels to naturally bypass clogged arteries in a noninvasive procedure"
294,Coronary Artery Disease,What is the outlook for CAD?,"Everyone’s outlook for CAD is different. You have better chances of preventingextensive damageto your heart the earlier you can start your treatment or implement lifestyle changes. It is important to follow your doctor’s instructions. Take medications as directed and make the recommended lifestyle changes. If you have a higher risk for CAD, you can help topreventthe disease by reducing your risk factors."
295,Depression,Overview,"Depression can be temporary or long-term. You may find help with mediation or different therapies, such as cognitive behavior therapy. It’s important to seek professional help if you’re feeling major depression. Depression is classified as a mood disorder. It may be described as feelings of sadness, loss, or anger that interfere with a person’s everyday activities. It’s also fairly common. Data from theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)estimates that 18.5 percent of American adults had symptoms of depression in any given 2-week period in 2019. Though depression and grief share some features, depression isdifferent from grieffelt after losing a loved one or sadness felt after a traumatic life event. Depression usually involves self-loathing or a loss of self-esteem, while grief typically does not. In grief, positive emotions and happy memories of the deceased typically accompany feelings of emotional pain. In major depressive disorder, the feelings of sadness are constant. People experience depression in different ways. It may interfere with your daily work, resulting in lost time and lower productivity. It can also influence relationships and some chronic health conditions. Conditions that can get worse due to depression include: arthritis asthma cardiovascular disease cancer diabetes obesity It’s important to realize that feeling down at times is a normal part of life. Sad and upsetting events happen to everyone. But if you’re feeling down or hopeless on a regular basis, you could be dealing with depression. Depression is considered a serious medical condition that can get worse without proper treatment.

296,Depression,Depression symptoms,"Depression can be more than a constant state of sadness or feeling “blue.” Major depression can cause a variety of symptoms. Some affect your mood and others affect your body. Symptoms may also be ongoing or come and go. Not everyone with depression will experience the same symptoms. Symptoms can vary in severity, how often they happen, and how long they last. If you experience some of the following signs andsymptomsof depression nearly every day for at least 2 weeks, you may be living with depression: feeling sad,anxious, or “empty” feeling hopeless, worthless, and pessimistic crying a lot feeling bothered, annoyed, or angry loss of interest in hobbies and interests you once enjoyed decreased energy orfatigue difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions moving or talking more slowly difficulty sleeping, early morning awakening, or oversleeping appetite or weight changes chronic physical pain with no clear cause that does not get better with treatment (headaches, aches or pains,digestive problems, cramps) thoughts of death, suicide, self-harm, or suicide attempts The symptoms of depressioncan be experienced differentlyamong males, females,teens, andchildren.

297,Depression,Depression causes,"There are several possible causes of depression. They can range from biological to circumstantial. Common causesinclude: Brain chemistry.There may be a chemical imbalance in parts of the brain that manage mood, thoughts, sleep, appetite, and behavior in people who have depression. Hormone levels.Changes in female hormonesestrogenandprogesteroneduring different periods of time like during themenstrual cycle,postpartum period, perimenopause, ormenopausemay all raise a person’s risk for depression. Family history.You’re at a higher risk for developing depression if you have a family history of depression or another mood disorder. Early childhood trauma.Some events affect the way your body reacts to fear and stressful situations. Brain structure.There’s a greater risk for depression if the frontal lobe of your brain is less active. However, scientists don’t know if this happens before or after the onset of depressive symptoms. Medical conditions.Certain conditionsmayput you at higher risk, such aschronic illness,insomnia,chronic pain,Parkinson’s disease,stroke,heart attack, andcancer. Substance use.A history of substance or alcohol misuse can affect your risk. Pain.People who feel emotional or chronic physical pain for long periods of time are significantlymore likelyto develop depression. Risk factors for depressioncan be biochemical, medical, social, genetic, or circumstantial. Common risk factors include: Sex.The prevalence of major depression is twice ashigh in femalesas in males. Genetics.You have anincreased riskof depression if you have a family history of it. Socioeconomic status.Socioeconomic status, including financial problems and perceived low social status,can increaseyour risk of depression. Certain medications.Certain drugs including some types ofhormonal birth control,corticosteroids, andbeta-blockersmay be associatedwith an increased risk of depression. Vitamin D deficiency.Studieshave linked depressive symptoms to low levels of vitamin D. Gender identity.The risk of depression for transgender people is nearly 4-fold that of cisgender people, according to a2018 study. Substance misuse.About21 percentof people who have asubstance use disorderalso experience depression. Medical illnesses.Depression is associated with other chronic medical illnesses. People with heart disease are abouttwice as likelyto have depression as people who don’t, while up to1 in 4 peoplewith cancer may also experience depression."
298,Depression,Treatment for depression,"You may successfully manage symptoms with one form of treatment, or you may find that a combination of treatments works best. It’s common to combine medical treatments and lifestyle therapies, including the following: Your healthcare professional may prescribe: SSRIsare themost commonlyprescribed antidepressant medications and tend to have few side effects. They treat depression by increasing the availability of the neurotransmitterserotoninin your brain. SSRIs shouldnot be takenwith certain drugs includingmonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs)and in some cases thioridazine or Orap (pimozide). People who are pregnant should talk to their healthcare professionals about the risks of taking SSRIs during pregnancy. You should alsouse cautionif you have narrow-angle glaucoma. Examples of SSRIs includecitalopram (Celexa),escitalopram (Lexapro),fluvoxamine(Luvox),paroxetine(Paxil, Paxil XR, Pexeva), andsertraline(Zoloft). SNRIstreat depression by increasing the amount of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in your brain. SNRIs should not be taken with MAOIs. You should use caution if you have liver or kidney problems, or narrow-angleglaucoma. Examples of SNRIs includedesvenlafaxine(Pristiq, Khedezla),duloxetine(Cymbalta, Irenka), levomilnacipran (Fetzima), andvenlafaxine(Effexor XR). Tricyclic antidepressants(TCAs) and tetracyclic antidepressants (TECAs) treat depression by increasing the amount of the neurotransmitters serotonin and norepinephrine in your brain. TCAscan causemore side effects than SSRIs or SNRIs. Do not take TCAs or TECAs with MAOIs. Use with caution if you have narrow-angle glaucoma. Examples of tricyclic antidepressants includeamitriptyline(Elavil),doxepin(Sinequan),imipramine(Tofranil), trimipramine (Surmontil),desipramine(Norpramin),nortriptyline(Pamelor, Aventyl), and protriptyline (Vivactil). These drugscan treatdepression by increasing the levels of dopamine and noradrenaline in your brain. Examples of NDRIs includebupropion (Wellbutrin). MAOIs treat depression byincreasing the levelsof norepinephrine, serotonin, dopamine, and tyramine in your brain. Due to side effects andsafety concerns, MAOIs are not the first choice for treating mental health disorders. They are typically used only if other medications are unsuccessful at treating depression. Examples of MAOIs include isocarboxazid (Marplan), phenelzine (Nardil), selegiline (Emsam), tranylcypromine (Parnate). N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagoniststreat depressionby increasing levels of glutamate in the brain. Glutamate is a neurotransmitter believed to be involved in depression. NMDA antagonists are used only in patients who have not had success with other antidepressant treatments. The FDA has approved one NMDA medication,esketamine(Spravato), for the treatment of depression. Esketamine is a nasal spray that is only available through a restricted program called Spravato REMS. Patients may experience tiredness and dissociation (difficulty with attention, judgment, and thinking) after taking the medication. For this reason, esketamine is administered in a healthcare setting where a healthcare professional can monitor for sedation and dissociation. Speaking with a therapistcan help you learn skills to cope with negative feelings. You may also benefit from family or group therapy sessions. Psychotherapy, also known as “talk therapy,” is when a person speaks to a trained therapist to identify and learn to cope with the factors that contribute to their mental health condition, such as depression. Psychotherapy hasbeen shownto be an effective treatment in improving symptoms in people with depression and other psychiatric disorders. Psychotherapy is often used alongside pharmaceutical treatment. There are many different types of psychotherapy, and some people respond better to one type than another. Incognitive behavioral therapy(CBT), a therapist will work with you to uncover unhealthy patterns of thought and identify how they may be causing harmful behaviors, reactions, and beliefs about yourself. Your therapistmightassign you “homework” where you practice replacing negative thoughts with more positive thoughts. Dialectical behavior therapy(DBT) is similar to CBT, but puts a specific emphasis on validation, or accepting uncomfortable thoughts, feelings, and behaviors, instead of fighting them. Thetheoryis that by coming to terms with your harmful thoughts or emotions, you can accept that change is possible and make a recovery plan. Psychodynamic therapyis a form of talk therapy designed to help you better understand and cope with your day-to-day life. Psychodynamic therapy isbased on the ideathat your present-day reality is shaped by your unconscious, childhood experiences. In this form of therapy, your therapist will help you reflect and examine your childhood and experiences to help you understand and cope with your life.

Exposure to doses of white lightcan help regulate your mood and improve symptoms of depression. Light therapy is commonly used inseasonal affective disorder, which is now called major depressive disorder with seasonal pattern. Talk with a health professional before using light therapy. Those with bipolar disorder can be at risk for mania using light therapy. Electroconvulsive therapy(ECT) uses electrical currents to induce a seizure, and hasbeen shownto help people with clinical depression. It’s used in people with severe depression or depression that is resistant to other treatments or antidepressant medications. During an ECT procedure, you’ll receive an anesthetic agent which will put you to sleep for approximately 5 to 10 minutes. Your healthcare professional will place cardiac monitoring pads on your chest and four electrodes on specific areas of your head. They will then deliver short electrical pulses for a few seconds. You will neither convulse nor feel the electrical current and will awaken about 5 to 10 minutes after treatment. Side effectsincludeheadaches, nausea, muscle aches and soreness, and confusion or disorientation. Patients may also develop memory problems, but these usually reside in the weeks and months after treatment Ask your doctor about alternative therapies for depression. Many people choose to use alternative therapies alongside traditional psychotherapy and medication. Some examples include: Meditation.Stress, anxiety, and anger are triggers of depression, butmeditationcan help change the way your brain responds to these emotions.Studiesshow that meditation practices can help improve symptoms of depression and lower your chances of a depression relapse. Acupuncture.Acupunctureis a form of traditional Chinese medicine that may help ease some symptoms of depression. During acupuncture, a practitioner uses needles to stimulate certain areas in the body in order to treat a range of conditions.Researchsuggests that acupuncture may help clinical treatments work better and may be as effective as counseling."
299,Depression,Natural remedies and lifestyle tips,"Aim for 30 minutes of physical activity 3 to 5 days a week.Exercisecan increase your body’s production ofendorphins, which are hormones that improve your mood. Drinking alcohol or misusing substancesmay make you feel better for a little bit. But in the long run, these substancescanmake depression andanxietysymptoms worse. Feeling overwhelmed can worsen anxiety and depression symptoms.Setting boundariesin your professional and personal life can help you feel better. You can also improve symptoms of depression by taking care of yourself. This includes getting plenty ofsleep,eating a healthy diet, avoiding negative people, and participating in enjoyable activities. Sometimes depression doesn’t respond to medication. Your healthcare professional may recommend other treatment options if your symptoms don’t improve. These options includeelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT)orrepetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)to treat depression and improve your mood. Several types of supplements may have some positive effect on depression symptoms. Take care to discuss any new supplements you may be taking with your healthcare team, as some supplements can have significant side effects or interact with medication. Someresearchsuggests this compound may ease symptoms of depression. The effects were best seen in people takingSSRIs. However, the results of this research is not conclusive and more research is needed. 5-HTPmay raiseserotonin levels in the brain, which could ease symptoms. Your body makes this chemical when you consume tryptophan, a building block of protein. However, more studies are needed. These essential fats are important to neurological development and brain health. Addingomega-3 supplementsto your dietmay helpreduce depression symptoms. However, there is some conflicting evidence and more research is needed. Always talk to your doctor before taking supplements, as they may interact with other medications or have negative effects. Vitamins are important to many bodily functions. Research suggests two vitamins are especially useful for easing symptoms of depression: Vitamin B:B-12 and B-6 are vital to brain health. When yourvitamin Blevels are low, your risk for developing depressionmay behigher. Vitamin D:Sometimes called thesunshine vitamin, vitamin D is important for brain, heart, and bone health. Theremay bea link between vitamin D deficiency and depression, but more research is needed. Many herbs, supplements, and vitamins claim to help ease symptoms of depression, but most haven’t shown themselves to be effective in clinical research."
300,Depression,Depression test,"There isn’t a single test to diagnose depression. But your healthcare provider can make a diagnosis based on your symptoms and a psychological evaluation. In most cases, they’ll ask aseries of questionsabout your: moods appetite sleep pattern activity level thoughts Because depression can be linked to other health problems, your healthcare professional may also conduct a physical examination and order blood work. Sometimesthyroid problemsor avitamin D deficiencycan trigger symptoms of depression. It’s important not to ignore symptoms of depression. If your mood doesn’t improve or gets worse, seek medical help. Depression is a serious mental health illness with the potential for complications. If left untreated, complicationscan include: weight gain or loss physical pain substance use disorder panic attacks relationship problems social isolation thoughts of suicide self-harm"
301,Depression,Types of depression,"Depression can be broken into categories depending on the severity of symptoms. Some people experience mild and temporary episodes, while others experience severe and ongoing depressive episodes. There are twomain types: major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder. Major depressive disorder(MDD) is the more severe form of depression. It’s characterized by persistent feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness that don’t go away on their own. In order to be diagnosed with clinical depression, you must experience five or more of the following symptoms over a 2-week period: feeling depressed most of the day loss of interest in most regular activities significant weight loss or gain sleeping a lot ornot being able to sleep slowed thinking or movement fatigueor low energy most days feelings of worthlessness or guilt loss of concentration or indecisiveness recurring thoughts of death or suicide There are different subtypes of major depressive disorder, which the American Psychiatric Association refers to as “specifiers.” Theseinclude: atypicalfeatures anxious distress mixed features peripartum onset, during pregnancy or right after giving birth seasonal patterns melancholicfeatures psychoticfeatures catatonia Persistent depressive disorder(PDD) used to be called dysthymia. It’s a milder, but chronic, form of depression. In order for the diagnosis to be made, symptoms must last for at least2 years. PDD can affect your life more than major depression because it lasts for a longer period. It’s common for people with PDD to: lose interest in normal daily activities feel hopeless lack productivity have low self-esteem Depression can be treated successfully, but it’s important to stick to your treatment plan. Living with depression can be difficult, but treatment can help improve your quality of life. Talk to your healthcare professional about possible options. The Healthline FindCare toolcan provide options in your area if you don’t already have a doctor. Postpartum depressionrefers to depression that happens after childbirth. It is a common disorder after pregnancy, affecting1 in 9 new parents. It’s common for people to experience “baby blues,” or feelings of sadness or emptiness after childbirth. For many people, these symptoms go away in a couple of days. But if you feel sad, hopeless, or empty for longer than 2 weeks post-childbirth, you may have postpartum depression. Symptoms of postpartum depression can range from mild to severe and caninclude: feeling restless or moody feeling sad, hopeless, or overwhelmed having thoughts of hurting the baby or yourself not having an interest in the baby, feeling disconnected, or as if your baby is someone else’s having no energy or motivation eating too little or too much sleeping too little or too much having trouble focusing having memory problems feeling worthless, guilty, or like a bad parent withdrawing from activities you once enjoyed withdrawing from friends and family having headaches, aches, or stomach issues that don’t go away feeling empty, unconnected, or as though you might not love or care for the baby Postpartum depression is thought to betriggered bythe dramatic hormonal changes that take place after pregnancy. Bipolar depression occurs in certain types ofbipolar disorderwhen a person experiences a depressive episode. Bipolar disorder is a mental disorder thatcausesdistinct changes in mood, energy, concentration, and the ability to carry out your day-to-day tasks. There are three types of bipolar disorder, all of which include periods known as manic episodes, where you feel extremely “up,” elated, or energized, and depressive episodes where you feel “down,” sad, or hopeless. If you have bipolar disorder, it can be hard to recognize the harmful effects of each “mood episode.” People having a depressive episodemay: feel very sad, hopeless, or empty feel slowed down or restless have trouble falling asleep, wake up too early, or sleep too much have an increased appetite and weight gain talk very slowly, forget things, or feel like they have nothing to say have trouble concentrating or making decisions feel unable to do basic tasks have little interest in activities have a decreased or absent sex drive have thoughts of death or suicide Symptoms during a depressive episode last every day for most of the day and can last for several days or weeks. If bipolar disorder is treated, many will experience fewer and less severe symptoms of depression, if they experience depressive episodes."
302,Depression,Depression and anxiety,"Depression andanxietycan occur in a person at the same time. In fact, research has shown that over70 percentof people with depressive disorders also have symptoms of anxiety. Though they’re thought to be caused by different things, depression and anxiety can produce several similar symptoms, which can include: irritability difficulty with memory or concentration sleep problems The two conditions also share some common treatments. Both anxiety and depression can be treated with: therapy, likecognitive behavioral therapy medication alternative therapies, includinghypnotherapy If you think you’re experiencing symptoms of either of these conditions or both of them, make an appointment to talk with your healthcare professional. You can work with them toidentify coexisting symptoms of anxiety and depressionand how they can be treated."
303,Depression,Depression and obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD),"Obsessive-compulsive disorder(OCD) causes unwanted and repeated thoughts, urges, and fears (obsessions). These fears cause you to act out repeated behaviors or rituals (compulsions) that you hope will ease the stress caused by the obsessions. People diagnosed with OCD frequently find themselves in a loop of obsessions and compulsions. If you have these behaviors, you may feel isolated because of them. This can lead to withdrawal from friends and social situations, which can increase your risk for depression. It’s not uncommon for someone with OCD to also have depression. Having one anxiety disorder can increase your odds for having another. Up to80 percentof people with OCD also have depression episodes. This dual diagnosis is a concern with children, too. Their compulsive behaviors, which may be first developing at a young age, can make them feel unusual. That can lead to withdrawing from friends and can increase the chance of a child developing depression."
304,Depression,Depression with psychosis,"Some individuals who have been diagnosed with major depression may also have symptoms of another mental disorder calledpsychosis. When the two conditions occur together, it’s known as “major depressive disorder, severe with psychotic features,” ordepressive psychosis. Depressive psychosis causes people to see, hear, believe, or smell things that aren’t real. People with the condition may also experience feelings of sadness, hopelessness, and irritability. The combination of the two conditions is particularly dangerous. That’s because someone with depressive psychosis may experience delusions that cause them to have thoughts of suicide or to take unusual risks. It’s unclear what causes these two conditions or why they can occur together, but treatment can successfully ease symptoms. Treatments include medications andelectroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Understanding the risk factors and possible causes can help you be aware of early symptoms."
305,Depression,Depression in pregnancy,"Pregnancy is often an exciting time for people. However, it can still be common for a pregnant woman to experience depression. Symptoms ofdepression during pregnancyinclude: changes in appetite or eating habits feeling hopeless anxiety losing interest in activities and things you previously enjoyed persistent sadness troubles concentrating or remembering sleep problems, including insomnia or sleeping too much thoughts of death or suicide Treatment for depression during pregnancy may focus entirely on talk therapy and other natural treatments. While some women do take antidepressants during their pregnancy, it’s not clear which ones are the safest. Your healthcare provider may encourage you to try an alternative option until after the birth of your baby. The risks for depression can continue after the baby arrives.Postpartum depression, which is also called major depressive disorder with peripartum onset, is a serious concern for new mothers."
306,Depression,Depression and alcohol,"Research has established a link between alcohol use and depression. People who have depression are more likely to misuse alcohol. Out of the 20.2 million U.S. adults who experienced a substance use disorder, about50 percenthad a co-occurring mental illness. Drinking alcohol frequently can make symptoms of depression worse, and people who have depression are more likely to misuse alcohol or become dependent on it."
307,Depression,Preventing depression,"Depression isn’t generally considered to be preventable. It’s hard to recognize what causes it, which means preventing it is more difficult. But once you’ve experienced a depressive episode, you may be better prepared to prevent a future episode by learning which lifestyle changes and treatments are helpful. Techniques that may help include: regular exercise getting plenty of sleep maintaining treatments reducing stress building strong relationships with others Other techniques and ideas may also help you prevent depression."
308,Depression,Outlook for depression,"Depression can be temporary, or it can be a long-term challenge. Treatment doesn’t always make your depression go away completely. However, treatment often makes symptoms more manageable. Managing symptoms of depression involves finding the right combination of medications and therapies. If one treatment doesn’t work, talk with your healthcare professional. They can help you create a different treatment plan that may work better in helping you manage your condition.

309,Diabetes,Overview,"Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease that causes high blood sugar. Your body either doesn’t make enough insulin or can’t effectively use the insulin it makes. The hormone insulin moves sugar from the blood into your cells to be stored or used for energy. If this malfunctions, you may have diabetes. Untreated high blood sugar from diabetes can damage your nerves, eyes, kidneys, and other organs. But educating yourself about diabetes and taking steps to prevent or manage it can help you protect your health."
310,Diabetes,Types of diabetes,"There are a few different types of diabetes: Type 1:Type 1 diabetesis anautoimmune disease. The immune system attacks and destroys cells in thepancreas, where insulin is made. It’s unclear what causes this attack, but in the past decade researchers have developed a 3-stage classification for the onset of this autoimmune condition, leading from pre-clinical lab diagnostic testing to when you may notice symptoms and begin treating T1D. Type 2:Type 2 diabetesoccurs when your body becomes resistant toinsulin, and sugar builds up in your blood. It’s the most common type—about90% to 95%of people living with diabetes have type 2. Type 1.5:More commonly known aslatent autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA), this type occurs during adulthood and sets in gradually like type 2 diabetes. LADA is an autoimmune disease that is similar to T1D in nature and cannot be treated by eating or lifestyle changes, but can have a gradual onset like T2D. Gestational:Gestational diabetesis high blood sugar during pregnancy. Insulin-blocking hormones produced by the placenta cause this type of diabetes. A rare condition calleddiabetes insipidusis not related to diabetes mellitus, although it has a similar name. It’s a different condition in which your kidneys remove too much fluid from your body. Each type of diabetes has unique symptoms, causes, and treatments."
311,Diabetes,Prediabetes,"Prediabetesis the term that’s used when your blood sugar is higher than expected, but it’s not high enough for a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes. It occurs when the cells in your body don’t respond to insulin the way they should. This can lead to type 2 diabetes down the road. Experts suggest that more than1 in 3 Americanshave prediabetes, but many people with prediabetes don’t even know they have it."
312,Diabetes,Symptoms of diabetes,"Diabetes symptoms are caused by rising blood sugar. The symptoms of type 1, type 2, and LADA are the same, but T1D symptoms develop in a shorter period than LADA and T2D. The other types often develop more gradually. In T2D, the onset tends to be slower, and tingling nerves and slow-healing sores are more common. The general symptoms of diabetes include: increased hunger increased thirst weight loss frequent urination blurry vision extreme fatigue sores that don’t heal Left untreated, T1D can lead todiabetic ketoacidosis. This is a medical emergency when there is a dangerous level of ketones in the body. It’s less common in other types of diabetes, but still possible. Since 2015, researchers and the diabetes medical community have divided T1D’s onset intothree stages: Stage 1:Pre-clinical. You may test positive for 2 or more diabetes-related autoantibodies. The immune system has already begun attacking the insulin-producing beta cells, although there are no symptoms and blood sugar remains normal. Stage 2:Pre-clinical. Like Stage 1, in this stage you may test positive for 2 more diabetes-related autoantibodies. Blood sugar levels are higher due to the gradual loss of beta cell function, but there are no other symptoms. Stage 3:Symptoms develop. This is where people may notice symptoms and a clinical diagnosis may take place. Insulin-producing beta cells has led to symptoms that can become life threatening quickly."
313,Diabetes,What causes diabetes?,Differentcausesare associated with each type of diabetes.
314,Diabetes,At what age can you develop diabetes?,"The short answer: You can develop any type of diabetesat any age. While T1D was once viewed as “juvenile diabetes” in children, the modern understanding is that this autoimmune condition can develop at any age. That is largely what’s led to theLADA designationfor adults, to help distinguish this as a sort of sibling of T1D that develops later in adulthood. Type 2 canalso developin adults and children, though the risk is higher as one ages, along with other risk factors. The same goes for gestational diabetes, which is most often diagnosed in those 25 and older but can also be seen in pregnant people who are younger than their mid-20s."
315,Diabetes,What are the complications of diabetes?,"High blood sugar damages organs and tissues throughout your body. The higher your blood sugar is and the longer you live with it, the greater your risk for complications. Possible long-termcomplicationsof any type of diabetes diabetes can include: heart disease,heart attack, andstroke neuropathy nephropathy retinopathyandvision loss hearing loss foot damage, such as infections and sores that don’t heal skin conditions, such asbacterialandfungalinfections depression dementia Unmanaged gestational diabetes can lead to problems that affect both the mother and baby. Complications affecting the baby can include: premature birth higher-than-typical weight at birth increased risk for type 2 diabetes later in life low blood sugar jaundice stillbirth A pregnant person with gestational diabetes can develop complications such as high blood pressure (preeclampsia) or type 2 diabetes. You may also requirecesarean delivery, commonly referred to as a C-section. There is also ahigher riskof developing gestational diabetes in future pregnancies."
316,Diabetes,How do you treat diabetes?,"Treating diabetes depends largely on the type. For those with T1D and LADA, you must take insulin. This may be through injections, prefilled insulin pens, an insulin pump device, or inhaled insulin. LADA can be challenging to treat because it may be misdiagnosed as T2D, and your need for insulin may be masked at the time of diagnosis. This means your doctor may not immediately prescribe insulin if you’re being or have been diagnosed already with T2D. But as other treatments don’t work as effectively, that may eventually lead to a correct LADA diagnosis and insulin use. For T2D, you may not need insulin to treat the condition. Depending on many factors, your doctor may prescribe eating or exercise changes to manage the condition. They may also prescribe pills or other medications that are not insulin. But many people with T2D effectively manage their condition with insulin, and this is not a signal that you’ve done anything wrong or that you are to blame for needing insulin. Your healthcare team should not discourage insulin if you have T2D if other treatment options have not allowed you to manage the condition effectively. If you receive a diagnosis of gestational diabetes, you’ll need tomonitor your blood sugar levelseveral times per day during pregnancy. If it’s high, dietary changes and exercise may be enough to bring it down. Research has found that about15% to 30%of women who develop gestational diabetes will need insulin to lower their blood sugar. Insulin is safe for the developing baby. Insulinis a hormone that helps regulate blood sugar levels. However, for people with diabetes, the body doesn’t produce or use this hormone effectively, and you need to supplement that natural process. Various types of insulin exist. They come in different brands and work differently, from how quickly they start to work to how long their effects last. Rapid-acting insulin:starts to work within 15 minutes and its effects last for 2 to 4 hours Short-acting insulin:starts to work within 30 minutes and lasts 3 to 6 hours Intermediate-acting insulin:starts to work within 2 to 4 hours and lasts 12 to 18 hours Long-acting insulin:starts to work 2 hours after injection and lasts up to 24 hours Ultra-long acting insulin:starts to work 6 hours after injection and lasts 36 hours or more Premixed insulin:starts working within 15 to 30 minutes (depending on whether a rapid-acting or short-acting insulin is part of the mix) and lasts 10 to 16 hours"
317,Diabetes,What do you eat with diabetes?,"Healthy eating is anessential partof diabetes management. Your blood sugar level rises or falls based on what you eat and drink. Starchy or sugary foods and beverages make blood sugar levels rise rapidly. Protein and fat cause more gradual increases. Counting carbohydrates is an important part of eating for those with diabetes who take insulin and manage their blood sugar levels. A dietitian or nutritionist can help you figure out how many grams of carbs to eat at each meal. Your medical team may recommend that you limit the amount of carbohydrates you eat each day. You’ll also need to balance your carb intake with your insulin doses. Counting carbs helps to balance the carb intake with the insulin doses. In some cases, changing your eating habits may be enough to manage the disease."
318,Diabetes,Diabetes and exercise,"Your physical activity levels also play a big role in diabetes management, no matter the type. Staying activehelps your cellsreact to insulin more effectively and lowers your blood sugar levels. Exercising regularly can also help you: reach and maintain a healthy weight reduce your risk of diabetes-related health complications boost mood get better sleep improve memory If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes, general guidance is to aim for at least150 minutesof moderate-intensity exercise each week. There are currently no separate exercise guidelines for people who have gestational diabetes. But if you’re pregnant, start out slowly and gradually increase your activity level over time to avoid overdoing it. Talk with your doctor about safe ways to incorporate activity into your diabetes management plan. You may need to take special precautions, like checking your blood sugar before and after working out and staying hydrated. Here are thetypes of doctors and healthcare professionalsyou may need as part of your diabetes care team. If you don’t already have a primary care specialist, you can browse doctors in your area through theHealthline FindCare tool."
319,Diabetes,How is diabetes diagnosed?,"Anyone who has symptoms of diabetes or is at risk for the condition should be tested. People are routinely tested for gestational diabetes during theirsecond trimesterorthird trimesterof pregnancy. Doctors use theseblood teststo diagnose prediabetes and diabetes: The fasting plasma glucose (FPG) test measures your blood sugar after you’ve fasted for 8 hours. TheA1C testprovides a snapshot of your blood sugar levels over the previous 3 months. A 75-gram oral glucose tolerance test is also used. This checks the BG 2 hours after ingesting a sugary drink containing 75 grams of carbs. Todiagnose gestational diabetes, your doctor will test your blood sugar levels between the24th weekand28th weekof pregnancy. There are two types of tests: Glucose challenge test:During a glucose challenge test, your blood sugar is checked an hour after you drink a sugary liquid. If your results are standard, no more testing is done. If blood sugar levels are high, you’ll need to undergo a glucose tolerance test. Glucose tolerance test:During a glucose tolerance test, your blood sugar is checked after you fast overnight. Then, you’re given a sugary drink, and your blood sugar is re-tested after 1 hour and again after 2 hours. Gestational diabetes is diagnosed if any of these three readings indicate high blood sugar. The earlier you are diagnosed with diabetes, the sooner you can start treatment. Find out whether you should get tested, and getmore information on testsyour doctor might perform."
320,Diabetes,Can you prevent diabetes?,"Neither T1D or LADA are preventable, because they are autoimmune conditions. People who’ve never had diabetes can also suddenly develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy. Hormones produced by the placenta can make your body moreresistant to the effects of insulin. You can lower your risk of developing T2D, though it isn’t guaranteed that you can always prevent it because there are genetic and age-related links between how and why it develops in certain people. However, some T2D risk factors are manageable. Most diabetes prevention strategies involve making simple adjustments to your eating habits and fitness routine. If you’ve received a diagnosis ofprediabetes, here are a few things you can do to delay or prevent T2D: Get at least 150 minutes per week ofaerobic exerciseslike walking orcycling. Cutsaturatedandtransfats, along withrefined carbohydrates, out of your diet. Eat morefruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Eat smaller portions. Try to lose5% to 7%of your body weight if you are overweight or live with obesity."
321,Diabetes,The takeaway,"There are a few main types of diabetes, and while they differ, they involve blood sugar regulation in your body. Type 1 and adult-diagnosed LADA require insulin, while those with both T2D and gestational diabetes during pregnancy may be able to manage the condition without insulin. The main components of managing diabetes are blood sugar monitoring, eating habits, physical activity levels, and mental health considerations. Discuss potential diabetes risks with your doctor. If you’re at risk, have your blood sugar tested and follow your doctor’s advice for managing your blood sugar."
322,Diarrhea,Overview,"Diarrhea, or “the runs,” is when you experience loose, watery stools and feel the urgent need to have a bowel movement multiple times a day. A few causes include infections, diseases, and food intolerances. Diarrhea can be acute or chronic. Acute diarrhea occurs when the condition lasts for 1 to 2 days. You might experience diarrhea due to a viral or bacterial infection you acquired via something you ate or drank. Chronic diarrhearefers to having diarrhea on most days for longer than 3 to 4 weeks. Some common causes of chronic diarrhea include: irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) conditions, such as celiac disease, that affect the absorption of certain nutrients"
323,Diarrhea,What causes diarrhea?,"You may experience diarrhea because of several conditions or circumstances.Potential causesof diarrhea include: viral infections includingrotavirus,norovirus, andviral gastroenteritis bacterial infections, includingSalmonellaandE. coli parasitic infections intestinal diseases a food intolerance, such aslactose intolerance an adverse reaction to a medication gallbladder or stomach surgery Rotavirus is the most common cause of acute diarrhea globally. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), this infection causes around40 percentof hospitalizations in children under 5 years old. Globally, most diarrhea deaths are the result of contaminated water supplies and insufficient sanitation. In the United States, you are more likely to develop diarrhea due to food poisoning from eating contaminated foodstuffs. According to the CDC, annually there are close to48 milliondiarrheal illnesses caused by contaminated food in the United States. Chronic diarrhea may be a symptom of a more severe condition such asirritable bowel syndromeorinflammatory bowel disease. Frequent and severe diarrhea could be a sign of intestinal disease or a functional bowel disorder."
324,Diarrhea,What are the symptoms of diarrhea?,"The main symptoms of diarrhea are frequent loose, watery stools and a pressing urge to have a bowel movement. There are many different symptoms of diarrhea. You may experience only one of these or any combination of all of them. The symptoms depend on the cause. It’scommonto feel one or more of the following: nausea abdominal pain cramping bloating dehydration a frequent urge to evacuate your bowels a large volume of stools dehydration Diarrhea can cause you to lose fluids quickly and put you at risk for dehydration. If you don’t receive treatment for diarrhea, it can have severe effects. The symptoms of dehydration include: fatigue dry mucous membranes increasedheart rate a headache lightheadedness increased thirst decreased urination dry mouth Contact your doctor as soon as possible if you think your diarrhea is causing dehydration. Learn more about dehydration here. Children areparticularly susceptibleto diarrhea and dehydration. The CDC reports that diarrhea and its complications account for around1 in 9annual child deaths worldwide, making this the second leading cause of death in those under age 5. Call your child’s doctor or seek emergency care if you see symptoms of dehydration, such as: decreased urination dry mouth a headache fatigue a lack of tears when crying dry skin sunken eyes sunken fontanel sleepiness irritability"
325,Diarrhea,What are the treatment options for diarrhea?,"Research shows that the treatment for diarrheatypically requiresreplacing lost fluids. This means you need to drink more water or electrolyte replacement beverages, such as sports drinks. In more severe cases, you may get fluids through intravenous (IV) therapy. If a bacterial infection is the cause of your diarrhea, your doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Your doctor will decide your treatment based on: the severity of the diarrhea and related condition the frequency of the diarrhea and related condition the degree of your dehydration status your health your medical history your age your ability to tolerate different procedures or medications expectations for improvement of your condition"
326,Diarrhea,How is the cause of diarrhea diagnosed?,"Your doctor will complete a physical examination and consider your medical history when determining the cause of your diarrhea. They may also request laboratory tests to examine urine and blood samples. Additional tests your doctor may order to determine the cause of diarrhea and other related conditions can include: diet elimination tests to determine whether a food intolerance or allergy is the cause imaging tests to check for inflammation and structural abnormalities of the intestine a stool culture to check for bacteria, parasites, or signs of disease acolonoscopyto check the entire colon for signs of intestinal disease asigmoidoscopyto check the rectum and lower colon for signs of intestinal disease A colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is especially helpful for determining if you have an intestinal disease or severe or chronic diarrhea."
327,Diarrhea,How can I prevent diarrhea?,"Although diarrhea can occur for various reasons, there are actions that you can take to prevent it: You can avoid developing diarrhea from food poisoning by washing the cooking and food preparation areas more frequently. Serve food immediately after preparing it. Refrigerate leftovers promptly. Always thaw frozen food in a refrigerator. You can help preventtraveler’s diarrheaby taking the following steps when traveling: asking your doctor if you can begin an antibiotic treatment before you leave avoiding tap water, ice cubes, and fresh produce that has probably been washed with tap water while you’re on vacation drinking bottled water only while on vacation eating cooked food only while on vacation If you have diarrhea due to a viral or bacterial infection, you canprevent transmittingthe infection-causing agent to others by washing your hands more frequently. When you wash your hands, use soap and wash for 20 seconds. Use hand sanitizer when washing your hands isn’t possible."
328,Diarrhea,When to call a doctor,"Most cases of acute diarrhea are self-resolving, and symptoms will improve within a few days. However, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, if symptoms persist for longer than2 days, you should seek medical attention, as you may be getting dehydrated and need IV fluids or other treatment and evaluation. Diarrhea is also a symptom of some serious medical emergencies. If you experience loose, watery stools alongside any of the following symptoms, you should seek emergency help. A combination of these symptoms may be a sign of a severe underlying illness. a fever bloody stools frequent vomiting Seek immediate treatment ifany of the followingapply to your child: They’ve had diarrhea for 24 hours or more. They have a fever of 102°F (39°C) or higher. They have stools that contain blood. They have stools that contain pus. They have stools that are black and tarry. These are all symptoms that indicate an emergency. If you or someone around you experiences symptoms of severe diarrhea and dehydration or any of the symptoms above, call 911 or your local emergency number, or go to the nearest emergency department."
329,Diarrhea,Summary,"If you have diarrhea, you will typically experience loose, watery stools multiple times a day. You may also experience sudden urges to vacate your bowels. Diarrhea is often the result of a short-term infection but can lead to severe complications, notably dehydration. The condition can also be chronic, although this is less common. Viral and bacterial infections are the most common causes of diarrhea. Food intolerances, the side effects of medications, and underlying chronic conditions can also cause diarrhea. If you experience symptoms for more than 2 days, you should see a doctor. If a child under your care is displaying symptoms of diarrhea, seek medical assistance immediately. Children under 5 years old are particularly susceptible to diarrhea and dehydration, and this is often a medical emergency."
330,Digestive Problems,Overview,"There are many types of digestive system problems. Accurately identifying your specific symptoms is a crucial first step in developing an effective treatment plan and managing your condition. Thedigestive systemis an intricate and extensive part of your body. It starts from your mouth and extends up to the rectum. It helps your body absorb essential nutrients and remove waste. Digestion problems can mean more than unwanted symptoms. Minor problems, if left untreated, can lead to more serious or chronic (long-term) illnesses. Since there are various types of digestion problems, you might mistakenly dismiss them. So, it’s important to understand common digestion problems, as well as symptoms needing immediate medical intervention, so you know when to talk with a doctor."
331,Digestive Problems,Chronic constipation,"Chronic constipationindicates a problem with removing waste from the body. This often occurs when the colon can’t pass or move stools through the rest of the digestive tract. You may experience abdominal pain and bloating as well as fewer bowel movements (which are more painful than usual). Chronic constipation is one of the most common digestive problems in the United States.Getting enough fiber, water, and exercise will likely help curb constipation. Medications can also provide relief in more serious cases."
332,Digestive Problems,Food intolerance,"Food intoleranceoccurs when your digestive system can’t tolerate certain foods. Unlike food allergies, which can cause hives and respiratory problems, an intolerance only affects digestion. Symptoms of food intolerance include: bloatingor cramps diarrhea headache heartburn irritability gas vomiting You will receive the diagnosis of food intolerance from your doctor by keeping and getting your food diary reveiwed. Recording what you eat and when can help you identify which foods are triggering your symptoms. Celiac disease, an autoimmune disorder, is one type of food intolerance. It causes digestive problems when you eat gluten (a protein in wheat, barley, and rye). People with celiac disease must follow a gluten-free diet to minimize symptoms and damage to the small intestine."
333,Digestive Problems,GERD,"Heartburnis an occasional occurrence for many adults. This happens when stomach acids go back into the esophagus, causing chest pain and the trademark burning sensation. If you have more frequent heartburn, you might havegastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Such frequent episodes can interfere with your daily life and damage your esophagus. Symptoms of GERD include: chest discomfort dry cough sour taste in the mouth sore throat swallowing difficulties You may need medications to manage heartburn. A damaged esophagus can make swallowing difficult and disrupt the rest of the digestive system."
334,Digestive Problems,Inflammatory bowel disease,"Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD)is a type of chronic swelling. It affects one or more parts of the digestive tract. There are two types of IBD: Crohn’s disease: affects the entire gastrointestinal (GI) tract, but most commonly affects the small intestine and the colon ulcerative colitis: affects only the colon IBD can cause more general digestive system ailments, such as abdominal pain and diarrhea. Other symptoms can include: fatigue incomplete bowel movements loss of appetite and subsequent weight loss night sweats rectal bleeding It’s important to get the diagnosis and treatment for IBD as soon as possible. You will not only be more comfortable, but early treatment also reduces damage to the GI tract."
335,Digestive Problems,Possible serious conditions,"A gastroenterologist is a doctor who specializes in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases involving the digestive system. If you continue to experience digestion problems, it’s time to make an appointment with them. Some signs are more serious and could mean there’s an emergency medical problem. These signs include: bloody stools continuous vomiting severe abdominal cramps sweating sudden, unintentional weight loss These symptoms could be an indication of an infection,gallstones,hepatitis,internal bleeding, or cancer."
336,Digestive Problems,Takeaway,"You can overcome digestion problems with treatment and lifestyle changes. Certain conditions of the digestive system might be long term, but medications can help ease symptoms. Identifying specific digestion problems and talking with a gastroenterologist can go a long way in terms of getting a proper diagnosis. Remember, you don’t have to put up with constant digestive issues."
337,Dizziness,Overview,"Dizziness is a common symptom with a wide range of potential causes. These include inner ear problems, dehydration, low blood pressure, certain medications, and underlying health conditions like heart disease or anxiety. The sensation of dizziness can vary. You may feel lightheadedness, vertigo (a spinning sensation), unsteadiness, or loss of balance. It may be accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or fainting. Treatment for dizziness depends on the underlying cause and may involve lifestyle changes, home remedies like the Epley maneuver for vertigo, and medications. In severe cases, you may need medical procedures or surgery."
338,Dizziness,What is dizziness?,"Dizziness is the feeling of being lightheaded, woozy, or off-balance. It’s linked to the sensory organs, specifically the eyes and ears, so it can sometimes cause fainting. Dizziness isn’t a disease itself but rather a symptom of various disorders. Dizziness is common. Occasional dizziness isn’t something to worry about. However, it’s important to call a doctor immediately if you’re experiencing repeated episodes of dizziness for no apparent reason or for a prolonged period."
339,Dizziness,Dizziness causes,"Dizziness has a variety of possible causes. True dizziness is the feeling oflightheadednessor nearlyfainting. Vertigoand disequilibrium may both cause a feeling of dizziness, but these two terms describe distinct sensations. Vertigo is characterized by a spinning sensation, like the room is moving. It may also feel likemotion sicknessor as if you’re leaning to one side. Disequilibrium is a loss ofbalanceor equilibrium. A common cause of vertigo and vertigo-related dizziness isbenign positional vertigo (BPV). BPV leads to short-term dizziness when someone changes positions quickly, such as sitting up in bed after lying down. Dizziness and vertigo can also be triggered byMeniere’s disease. This condition causes fluid to build up in the ear with associatedear fullness,hearing loss, andtinnitus. Another possible cause of dizziness and vertigo is anacoustic neuroma. This noncancerous tumor forms on the vestibulocochlear nerve (auditory nerve), which connects the inner ear to the brain. Losing too much fluid can result indehydration, one of the most common causes of dizziness. Symptoms of dehydration include thirst and dry skin. Other common causes of dizziness include amigraine attackoralcohol. Dizziness can also result from a problem in theinner ear, which is the area that senses movement and regulates balance. These problems include hearing loss. Dizziness may be linked to certain medications, too, including: muscle relaxants antiepileptic drugs antihistamines blood pressure medications Some other potential causes of dizziness include: Sudden drop in blood pressure:Suddenlow blood pressuremay be caused by various medical conditions or even from standing up (orthostatic hypotension). It can lead to dizziness and falling, especially in older adults. Cardiomyopathy:Inthis condition, the heart muscles become rigid and weak and pump less blood. Symptoms can include dizziness, fainting, andtrouble breathing. Heart attack:While chest pain is the most common indicator of aheart attack, dizziness or lightheadedness can also besymptoms. They occur if there’s not enough blood reaching your brain. Arrhythmia:Arrhythmiaoccurs when the heart beats at an atypical pace. It can cause dizziness, lightheadedness, or shortness of breath. Circulation problems:Cardiomyopathy, heart attack, and other heart conditions can result incirculation problems, where your heart is unable to pump enough blood. This can cause you to feel dizzy. Excessive exercise:Overexerting yourselfmay make you feel dizzy or lightheaded. It can also lead to dehydration and heat exhaustion, which can both cause dizziness. Heat exhaustion:If you’re in a hot environment and sweating excessively, you’re likely experiencingheat exhaustion. The condition may make you feel dizzy, thirsty, and weak. Decrease in blood volume:Low blood volume can result from bleeding or dehydration. It can cause dizziness,fatigue, and low blood pressure. Learn more about the relationship betweendehydration and blood pressure. Anxiety disorders:Dizziness may berelated to anxietywith no other physical causes. You may have repeated episodes of dizziness. Anemia:Anemiais a low red blood cell count. Low levels of iron-rich hemoglobin in your red blood cells mean the cells can’t transport enough oxygen throughout the body. The lack of oxygen caused by anemia may make you feel dizzy, tired, or short of breath. Hypoglycemia:Hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, can make you feel shaky, lightheaded, or hungry. Severe hypoglycemia is a serious condition that can cause a seizure. Discover othersymptoms associated with hypoglycemia. Carbon monoxide poisoning:Ifcarbon monoxide fumesfrom cars, grills, or furnaces build up indoors, breathing them in can be fatal. Dizziness,headache, andvomitingare all symptoms. Motion sickness:Traveling by car or boat or experiencing other types of motion can give you motion sickness. You may feel dizzy andnauseous. Multiple sclerosis (MS):Multiple sclerosis (MS)damages the brain and spinal cord. It causes a range ofsymptomsthat can include dizziness. Parkinson’s disease:Dizziness is a common symptom ofParkinson’s disease, a neurological condition that causes shaking and balance issues. Dizziness may become more noticeable in laterstages of Parkinson’s. Infections:A variety of infections are associated with dizziness. Examples include:COVID-19:You may feel dizziness and vertigo while youhave or recover from COVID-19. The dizziness and vertigo may be associated withheadachesand a loss of balance.Other viral infections:Other viral infections, such as thefluor acold, may also cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded. These infections may be associated with dehydration as well.Ear infection:Anear infectionmay lead to inflammation in your inner ear, causing dizziness and balance troubles. Ear infections are associated with both bacterial and viral causes.Labyrinthitis andvestibular neuritis:Labyrinthitisandvestibular neuritisoccur when specific nerves in your inner ear become inflamed. Triggers often include viral infections, but they can vary. Bacterial infections are more common in people with labyrinthitis than in people with vestibular neuritis. COVID-19:You may feel dizziness and vertigo while youhave or recover from COVID-19. The dizziness and vertigo may be associated withheadachesand a loss of balance. Other viral infections:Other viral infections, such as thefluor acold, may also cause you to feel dizzy or lightheaded. These infections may be associated with dehydration as well.

Labyrinthitis andvestibular neuritis:Labyrinthitisandvestibular neuritisoccur when specific nerves in your inner ear become inflamed. Triggers often include viral infections, but they can vary. Bacterial infections are more common in people with labyrinthitis than in people with vestibular neuritis. In rare cases, astroke, amalignant tumor, or anotherbrain disordercan cause dizziness."
340,Dizziness,Symptoms related to dizziness,"People who are dizzy may experience various sensations, including: lightheadedness or faintness a false sense of spinning unsteadiness a loss of balance a feeling of floating Sometimes, dizziness is accompanied by nausea, vomiting, or fainting. Seek emergency medical help if you have these symptoms for extended periods. It’s important to call a doctor if you have repeated bouts of dizziness. Also, notify a doctor immediately if you experience sudden dizziness along with: a head injury a headache neck stiffness a high fever ongoing vomiting blurred vision hearing loss tinnitus difficulty speaking numbness or tingling droopiness of theeyeor mouth loss of consciousness chest pain heart palpitationsor alow heart rate These symptoms could indicate a serious health problem, so it’s important to seek medical attention as soon as possible. According to a 2021 Swedish study,5%of people who used emergency services for dizziness had a time-critical medical issue. If you don’t already have a primary care doctor, theHealthline FindCare toolcan help you find a physician in your area."
341,Dizziness,Dizziness treatment,"Treatment for dizziness focuses on the underlying cause. In most cases, home remedies and medical treatments can help you manage the underlying cause. The following are potential treatments for the causes of dizziness: Vertigo and benign positional vertigo (BPV):BPV, a common cause of vertigo, can often be resolved with theEpley maneuver. This exercise involves turning your head in specific ways to help alleviate symptoms. Surgery is typically not needed, but it’s an option for people who can’t manage their BPV otherwise. Meniere’s disease:This condition has no cure, but it may improve with medications, ahealthful low-salt diet, antibiotic orcorticosteroidinjections, or ear surgery. Acoustic neuroma:If the tumor grows, you may needradiationor surgery. Dehydration:To help treat dehydration, drink plenty of fluids. Migraine:Treatment for migraine attacks includesmedicationsandlifestyle changes, such as learning to identify and avoidmigraine triggers. Alcohol:Drinking less alcohol may help you avoid dizziness fromoverconsumption. Inner ear issues:You may be able to manage inner ear issues with medications or at-home exercises that help you maintain your balance. Medications:If medications seem to be causing your dizziness, speak with a doctor about changing your medication or dose. Sudden drop in blood pressure:Treatment for sudden low blood pressuredepends on the cause or underlying condition, but it may involve adjusting your medications, exercising, or changing positions slowly when standing up. Cardiomyopathy:This condition may be improved with medications or lifestyle changes such as quitting smoking andeating a heart-healthy diet. Heart attack:A heart attack requires emergency treatment, which may includemedications,oxygen therapy, or surgery. Arrhythmia:Arrhythmia doesn’t always require treatment. Healthy lifestyle choices, such as exercising and eating a balanced diet, can help you manage your symptoms. Heart medications are also available. Surgery is reserved for more serious cases. Circulation problems:Circulation problems may improve withregular exercise, a heart-healthy diet, medications, or surgery. Excessive exercise or heat exhaustion:Drinking plenty of fluids can help when dizziness is caused by excessive exercise or heat exhaustion. Decrease in blood volume:Treatment for low blood volume focuses on restoring fluids through an intravenous (IV) line and treating underlying causes such as bleeding. Anxiety disorders:Medicationsand anxiety-reducing techniques, such astherapy, can help with anxiety disorders. Anemia:Iron supplements, medications, andeating a balanced dietcan help treat anemia. Hypoglycemia:If you have symptoms of hypoglycemia, try drinking fruit juice or soda or takingglucose tablets. For severely low blood glucose levels, you may need an injection of the hormoneglucagon. Discover otheremergency treatments for hypoglycemia. Carbon monoxide poisoning:This condition requires immediate medical care. It may be treated with oxygen, aventilator, and IV fluids. Motion sickness:You can tryginger candy, aromatherapy, and over-the-counter (OTC) medications such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) for motion sickness. Learn more aboutremedies for motion sickness. Multiple sclerosis (MS):This condition currently has no cure, butphysical therapyandmedicationsmay help with symptoms. Parkinson’s disease:Medications, surgery, andexercisesmay improve Parkinson’s disease symptoms, though there isno cureat the moment. Infections:Treatment will depend on the cause of the infection but will likely include hydration and rest.COVID-19:Staying hydrated, resting, and doing balance exercises may help with dizziness that persists after aCOVID-19 infection. If your symptoms get worse, it’s important to have a doctor check for other underlying conditions.Other viral infections:Hydration and rest are key to recovery. Antiviral medications are also available to help you manage conditions such asthe flu.

342,Dizziness,Diagnosing the causes of dizziness,"A doctor can narrow down the cause of your dizziness by performing aphysical examination. They’ll ask you questions about your dizziness, including: when it occurs the situations where it occurs how severe your symptoms are which other symptoms occur with the dizziness A doctor may also: check youreyesandears perform a neurological exam observe yourposture If the doctor suspects certain causes, including carbon monoxide poisoning, heart conditions, or a stroke, they may recommend aCT scan, anMRI, or another imaging test. You may also need additional tests. In some cases, a doctor can’t determine the cause of dizziness. A doctor or specialist may perform tests to check your balance. These tests look for problems with your inner ear that may affect your balance or cause dizziness. They include: computerized dynamic posturography (CDP) test, where you try to maintain your balance while standing on a moving platform Romberg test, which measures how well you keep your balance when standing with your eyes closed for 1 minute electronystagmography (ENG) test, which involves a doctor placing sensors around your eyes and measuring your eye movements videonystagmography (VNG) test, in which you’ll wear goggles and view light patterns so a doctor can measure your eye movements rotary test, where goggles record your eye movements while you sit in a rotating, motorized chair If you have vertigo, the doctor may perform the following tests: Dix-Hallpike maneuver, which involves turning your head and then switching quickly between lying down and sitting up so a doctor can check if you experience vertigo vestibular evoked myogenic potentials (VEMP) test, in which a doctor looks for problems in your inner ear by playing sounds into earphones while you move your head and eyes video head impulse test, which records your eye movements as you try to keep your eyes on a target while moving your head Hearing tests may also be performed for dizziness and balance issues. These tests may include: otoacoustic emissions test, in which a small earphone plays sounds in your ear and a doctor measures the echoes that come back from your inner ear tympanometry, in which a doctor blows air into your ear to evaluate the movement of your eardrum electrocochleography, which tests the electrical activity of the cochlea (a hollow bone in theinner ear) using an electrode placed in the ear Electrocochleography can help diagnose Meniere’s disease. Tests that can help a doctor diagnose cardiac causes of dizziness include the: electrocardiogram (EKG), which they use to measure your heart’s electrical activity echocardiogram, which is a type of ultrasound that reveals how well your heart works stress test, where a doctor monitors your heart as you use a treadmill or perform another type of exercise"
343,Dizziness,Tips for managing dizziness,"Follow these tips if you have recurrent bouts of dizziness: Sit or lie down immediately when you feel dizzy and rest until the dizziness goes away. This can prevent you from possibly losing your balance, which may lead to falling and serious injury. Use a cane or walker for stability, if necessary. Always use handrails when walking up or down stairs. Try activities that can help improve your balance, such asyogaandtai chi. Avoid moving or switching positions suddenly. Avoid driving a car or operating heavy machinery if you frequently experience dizziness without warning. Avoid caffeine, alcohol, and tobacco. Using these substances may trigger dizziness or make it worse. Drink plenty of waterandget sufficient sleep. Avoiding stressful situations may also be helpful. If you suspect a medication is causing your dizziness, talk with your doctor about lowering the dose or switching to another medication. Take an OTC medication such asmeclizine(Antivert, Bonine) if you experience nausea along with dizziness. These medications may cause drowsiness, so do not use them when you need to be active or productive. Rest in a cool place and drink water if your dizziness is caused by overheating or dehydration. Always speak with a doctor if you’re concerned about the frequency or severity of your dizziness."
344,Dizziness,Takeaway,"Most cases of dizziness clear up on their own once you treat the underlying cause. In rare cases, dizziness can be a symptom of a more serious health problem. Dizziness may result in complications related to fainting or a loss of balance. This can be especially dangerous when you’re driving, operating heavy machinery, or climbing a ladder. Use caution if you feel an episode of dizziness coming on. If you become dizzy, stop driving immediately or find a safe place to steady yourself until the feeling passes. “”””"
345,Drug Abuse,Overview,"Substance use disorder is a health condition involving compulsive substance use. It can occur with prescription or nonprescription drugs. It can also range from mild to severe. Substance use disorder, formerly known as “drug abuse,” develops when substance use interferes with the ability to function day to day. Substance use disorder can range from mild to severe, depending on how it affects different areas of your life. Keep reading to learn more about substance use disorder, including types, risk factors, and how to treat it."
346,Drug Abuse,What is substance use disorder?,"A substance use disorder is a mental health condition in which a person experiences a pattern of symptoms surrounding substance use that negatively affects their health and quality of life. Substance use disorder exists on a spectrum from mild to severe, depending on the number of criteria a person meets. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR): One symptom could indicate a person is at risk of a substance use disorder. Two or three criteria point to a mild substance use disorder. Four or five symptoms show someone has a moderate substance use disorder. Six or more criteria indicate a severe substance use disorder, which signals an addiction to that substance. The DSM-5-TR criteria for substance use disorder include: Using more of a substance than intended or using it for longer than you’re meant to. Trying to cut down or stop using the substance but being unable to. Experiencing intense cravings or urges to use the substance. Needing more of the substance to get the desired effect, also called tolerance. Developing withdrawal symptoms when not using the substance. Spending more time getting and using the substance and recovering from use. Neglecting responsibilities at home, work, or school because of substance use. Continuing to use even when it causes relationship problems. Giving up important or desirable social and recreational activities due to substance use. Using substances in risky settings that put you in danger. Continuing to use despite the substance causing problems to your physical and mental health."
347,Drug Abuse,How do you develop substance use disorder?,People typically develop substance use disorder over time. This may look like: Experimental or prescription use:A person may try a substance once or take a prescription drug as directed by a doctor. Occasional use:A person may use the substance in social situations or use a prescription drug in a way not directed by a doctor. Regular or heavy use:A person may take a substance routinely. Substance use disorder:A person may take the substance daily or multiple times per day. They may rarely not be using the substance.
348,Drug Abuse,Who gets substance use disorder?,"Anyone can develop substance use disorder. However, some factors may increase the chance of developing a substance use disorder. Researchersare learning that specific genetics play a role in developing substance use disorder. However, genes are not the only factor. Genetics may combine with other factors in a person’s environment to increase their risk. Other risk factors for developing substance use disorder include: family member or peer use current or past physical,sexual, oremotionalabuse or neglect trauma access to these substances mental health disorders, such as:depressionanxietyeating disorderspersonality disorders depression anxiety eating disorders personality disorders substance use at an early age attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)"
349,Drug Abuse,What are the different types of substance use disorders?,"People may categorize some forms of substance use disorder based on the type of substance. Common types include: alcohol use disorder opioid use disorder cocaine use disorder meth use disorder The following section categorizes common substances and their associated symptoms. Substances classified as depressants (or central nervous system depressants) reduce activity in yourcentral nervous system (CNS). They typically make you feel relaxed and drowsy. Their effects vary depending on the amount consumed and an individual’s specific reaction to the substance. For example, low doses of depressants can actually have a stimulant effect and cause a euphoric feeling. Larger doses can cause depressant effects, such as cognitive impairment orloss of coordination. Alcohol use disorderoccurs when your use of alcohol affects your daily life, like your ability to work or maintain relationships. Heavy alcohol misuse can harm your health in the long term. Alcohol is the most commonly used recreational substance in the United States. The2022 National Survey on Drug Use and Healthfound that, over a 30-day period, approximately 137.4 million people 12 years old and older (48.7%) used alcohol at least once, and 16.1 million reported heavy alcohol use. Heroin is anopioidmade from the seed of the poppy plant. Heroin is also referred to as: smack H ska junk Heroin use can lead to: heart problems miscarriage overdose death Because regular heroin use leads to increased tolerance over time, you may need to take more of the substance to experience its desired effects. If abruptly stopped,withdrawal symptomstypically occur. Because of this, many people who use heroin may continue using it to avoid feeling sick. Stimulants increase CNS activity and can temporarily make someone feel more alert, energized, or confident. Cocainetypically produces ashort high. People typically use it by injecting it into veins, snorting it, or smoking it. Cocaine produces energetic and euphoric feelings. It’s also called: coke C crack snow flake blow Cocaine use increases: body temperature blood pressure heart rate Heavy and prolonged cocaine use can lead to: heart attack respiratory failure stroke seizures death Read more abouthow long cocaine stays in the bodyand how tomanage symptoms after stoppinguse. Methamphetamine is closely related toamphetamine. Other names for methamphetamine include: chalk meth ice crystal glad speed crank Methamphetaminestays in your bodyfor several days and can produce long-term wakefulness. It may also increase physical activity, which can result in increased: heart rate body temperature blood pressure If used for a long time, methamphetamine can lead to: mood problems violent behavior anxiety confusion insomnia severe dental problems Learnsigns that someone is using meth and how to respond. Cannabisis a dried mix of parts of thecannabis plant. It can produce feelings of euphoria, distorted perceptions, and trouble solving problems. Cannabis is also called: weed pot marijuana, though this term has racist connotations ganja grass 420 trees Cannabis use disordercan increaseyour risk of: cardiovascular disease cognitive impairment mental health disorders insomnia Learn more aboutcannabis use disorder. This category refers to a wide variety of substances people often use at dance parties, clubs, and bars. They include: Gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB):It’s also known as grievous bodily harm, G, and liquid ecstasy. Ketamine:Ketamineis also known as K, special K, vitamin K, and cat valium. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA):MDMAis also known as ecstasy, X, XTC, adam, clarity, and molly. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD):LSDis also known as acid. Flunitrazepam (Rohypnol):Flunitrazepam is also known as R2 or as a roofie, rophie, roche, or forget-me pill. Club drugs can lead to feelings of euphoria,detachment, or sedation.Due to their sedative qualities, roofies, in particular, have been used tocommit sexual assaults, or “date rape,” on unsuspecting people. Club drugs can cause: serious short-term mental health problems, such asdelirium physical health issues, such asrapid heart rate, seizures, anddehydration death Risks of these side effects increase when they’remixed with alcohol. Other commonly used substances do not fall into the above categories. Anabolic steroidsare also commonly known as: juice gym candy pumpers stackers Steroids are lab-made substances. They mimictestosterone, the male sex hormone, and people typically take them orally or inject them. In the United States, they’re legal with a prescription for certain medical uses, including to treat muscle wasting diseases. However, some people may use them toenhance athletic performanceand build strength. Anabolic steroids are banned by many sports institutions, including the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and the Olympics. Steroid use, especially over a long period, can cause serious and chronic health problems, including: aggressive behavior liver damage high blood pressure high cholesterol fertility issues Females who use anabolic steroids face additional symptoms, such as: facial hair growth menstrual cycle changes baldness a deepened voice Teens who use steroids may experience: impaired growth acceleratedpuberty severe acne The act of using inhalants is sometimes known as huffing. Inhalants are also known as: whip-its poppers snappers Inhalants are chemical vapors that people breathe to experience mind-altering effects. They include common products, such as: glue hair spray paint lighter fluid The short-term effects cause a feeling similar to alcohol use. Using inhalants comes with risks. They can lead to: a loss of sensation a loss of consciousness a loss of hearing spasms brain damage heart failure Doctors prescribe medication to help manage pain and other conditions. But some people may take a medication that’s not prescribed to them, or take it for reasons other than those prescribed by their doctor. Some people who take these medications can develop a substance use disorder, even when they’re using the medication exactly as prescribed. These drugsmay include: opioidsfor pain management, such as:fentanyl(Duragesic, Subsys)oxycodone(OxyContin, Xtampza ER)acetaminophen/hydrocodone fentanyl(Duragesic, Subsys) oxycodone(OxyContin, Xtampza ER) acetaminophen/hydrocodone anxietyorsleepmedications, such asalprazolam(Xanax) ordiazepam(Valium) stimulants, such as methylphenidate (Ritalin) oramphetamine/dextroamphetamine(Adderall) Their effects differ depending on the medication, but misusing prescription drugs can lead to: drowsiness depressed breathing slowed brain function anxiety paranoia seizures"
350,Drug Abuse,Complications of substance use disorder,"Substance use and substance use disorder can potentially lead to other problems, such as: drunk and impaired driving violence familial stress child abuse and neglect, in some situations legal problems negative health effects, including cancer and chronic health conditions mental health conditions"
351,Drug Abuse,How do you treat substance use disorder?,"Medical treatment is available for substance use disorders. The specific treatment may vary depending on the substance and personal factors. Treatment typically includes: detoxification (“detox”) medications to reduce withdrawal symptoms therapy to support your recovery monitoring toprevent relapses Depending on the type of substance use disorder, the first stage of treatment may be medically assisted detoxification. During this process, healthcare professionals provide supportive care as the substance is cleared from your bloodstream. Learn about the detox process forcocaine,cannabis,alcohol, andtramadol. Detoxification is followed by other treatments to support long-term abstinence. Many treatments involve both individual therapy, such ascognitive behavioral therapy, and group counseling. These are provided in outpatient facilities or inpatient residential recovery programs. Medications can also reduce withdrawal symptoms and encourage recovery. Inheroin use disorder, for example, your doctor may prescribe a medication calledmethadoneor buprenorphine/naloxone (Suboxone). These medications can ease your recovery and help you cope with the intense withdrawal stage."
352,Drug Abuse,How to prevent substance use disorder,"The best way to avoid a substance use disorder is to prevent use in the first place. However, while abstaining from substances is the safest approach, it may not be the most realistic. Because of this, education and safety practices are helpful tools to reduce harm and avoid addiction. These can include: mental health care, including therapy community programs reducing stigma developinghealthy coping mechanismsfor times of stress and change Harm reduction programs can also reduce complications of substance use and connect people to treatment. If a doctor prescribes a prescription drug that has a risk of addiction, it’s best to follow all directions from the doctor and pharmacist while taking the medication. Never give your prescription medications to another person. If you have extra doses you no longer need, return them through a pharmacy or community take-back program."
353,Drug Abuse,Resources and support groups for substance use disorder,"Consider using the following resources for support and treatment referral: Above the Influenceprovides information targeted at youth and young adults regarding substance use, peer pressure, and treatment options.

354,Ear Infections,Overview,"Experiencing inner ear discomfort or constant pressure, pus drainage, or hearing loss may be symptoms of an ear infection. You can use over-the-counter (OTC) treatments or consult a doctor if your symptoms don’t improve. Ear infections can be either bacterial or viral infections. They can occur in your middle ear, the part of your ear just behind your eardrum, as well as the outer and inner ear. They often clear up on their own but can be painful due to inflammation or fluid buildup. Ear infections can be chronic or acute. Acute ear infections are painful but short in duration. Chronic ear infections either don’t clear up or recur many times. They can cause damage to the middle and inner ear, which is infrequently permanent. Keep reading to learn about ear infections, including causes, symptoms, and treatment options."
355,Ear Infections,What are the symptoms of ear infections?,"Common symptoms of ear infections include: mild pain or discomfort inside your ear a persistent feeling ofpressure inside your ear pus-like eardrainage hearing loss These symptoms might persist or come and go. Symptoms may occur in one or both ears. Pain is usually more severe with adouble ear infection, which is an infection in both ears. Chronic ear infection symptoms may be less noticeable than those of acute ear infections. Along with symptoms seen in adults, such asear painand drainage, young children and babies may show other signs of an ear infection, such as: rubbing or pulling their ear fever not reacting to certain sounds frequently losing balance headache fussiness or restlessness loss of appetite Usually, ear infections last fewer than3 days, but they can persist for up to a week. Children younger than 6 months who have a fever or other ear infection symptoms should see a doctor. Seek medical attention if your child has a fever higher than 102°F (39°C) or severe ear pain."
356,Ear Infections,What causes an ear infection and what increases your risk?,"Ear infections are caused by viruses or bacteria, particularly the bacteriaStreptococcus pneumoniaeorHaemophilus influenzae. They often result from a blockage of yourEustachian tubes, which causes fluid to build up in your middle ear. Eustachian tubes are small tubes that run from each of your ears directly to the back of your throat. Causes of Eustachian tube blockage include: allergies colds sinus infections excess mucus smoking changes in air pressure Ear infections can also develop from infectedadenoids. Your adenoids are glands on the roof of your mouth behind your nose that help protect your body from infections. Infections can spread from these glands to the nearby ends of your Eustachian tubes. Ear infections occur most commonly in young children because they have short and narrow Eustachian tubes. About80 percentof children develop an acute ear infection at some point. Infants who are bottle-fed also have ahigher incidenceof ear infections than their breastfed counterparts. Other factors that increase the risk of developing an ear infection are: altitude changes changes in temperature and humidity exposure to cigarette smoke pacifier use recent illness or ear infection being male low birth weight lack of access to healthcare being in daycare"
357,Ear Infections,Potential complications of an ear infection,"Ear infections usually clear up without intervention, but they may recur. These rare but serious complications may follow an ear infection: hearing loss speech or language delay in children, which is more common when there is chronic fluid in the middle ear mastoiditis(an infection of the mastoid bone in the skull) meningitis(a bacterial infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal cord) ruptured eardrum"
358,Ear Infections,How are ear infections treated?,"While most mild ear infections clear up without intervention, the following treatments can also help: These methods are effective in relieving the symptoms of a mild ear infection: Apply a warm cloth to the affected ear. Take over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication such asibuprofen (Advil) or acetaminophen (Tylenol). Use OTC or prescriptionear dropsto relieve pain. TakeOTC decongestantslike pseudoephedrine (Sudafed). Avoid sleeping on the affected ear. If your symptoms get worse or don’t improve, see a doctor. They may prescribe antibiotics if your ear infection is bacterial, chronic, or doesn’t appear to be improving. Antibiotics don’t help treat viral infections. Doctors often take a wait-and-see approach when treating ear infections in children to avoid over-prescribing antibiotics, which can lead to antibiotic resistance. A doctor may sometimes write you a prescription for antibiotics if symptoms are severe or don’t resolve within 2 to 3 days. Alternatively, they may write you a prescription but recommend waiting first to see if your child’s symptoms get better after 2 to 3 days. It’s important to finish your entire prescription. Often, a7- or 10-dayprescription of amoxicillin is prescribed. You shouldn’t give children aspirin without their doctor’s instruction. Aspirin is a preventable risk factor for developingReyes’ syndrome, a rare disorder that causes brain and liver damage. Surgery may be an option if your ear infection isn’t eliminated with the usual medical treatments or if you have many ear infections over a short period. Most often,ear tubesare placed in your ears to allow fluid to drain out. These tubes are surgically inserted into your eardrums. They eventually fall out and the holes heal over. Sometimes these holes need to be closed surgically. If you have infections with tubes in place, symptoms will be drainage rather than pain, pressure, or fever. These ear infections can be treated with drops. A myringotomy surgery is another option. During this procedure, a doctor creates a small hole in your eardrum to let fluid drain and to relieve pain. The incision heals within afew days. In cases that involve enlarged adenoids,surgical removal of your adenoidsmay be recommended."
359,Ear Infections,When to see a doctor,"TheCenters for Disease Control and Preventionrecommends seeing a doctor when your child has: a fever over 102.2°F pus, discharge, or fluid leaking from your ear worsening symptoms symptoms for more than 2 to 3 days hearing loss other concerning symptoms For adults, it’s a good idea to visit a doctor if your symptoms last longer than 2 or 3 days, or you have severe pain or a fever."
360,Ear Infections,How are ear infections diagnosed?,"A healthcare professional will consider your symptoms and examine your ears with an instrument called an otoscope that has a light and magnifying lens. The examination may reveal: redness, air bubbles, or pus-like fluid inside the middle ear fluid draining from the middle ear a perforation in the eardrum a bulging or collapsed eardrum This exam is rarely painful, but some children may be bothered. Other tests include: Fluid sample.If your infection is advanced, your doctor may take a sample of the fluid inside your ear and test it to determine whether certain types of antibiotic-resistant bacteria are present. Computed tomography (CT) scan.Your doctor may order aCT scanof your head to determine if the infection has spread beyond your middle ear. Blood tests.Blood testscan check your immune function. Tympanometry.Tympanometryallows doctors to measure how well your eardrum responds to changes in air pressure inside your ear. Acoustic reflectometry.This test measures how much sound is reflected back from your eardrum to indirectly measure the amount of fluid in your ear. Hearing test.You may need ahearing test, especially if you have chronic ear infections."
361,Ear Infections,How can ear infections be prevented?,"The following practices may reduce the risk of ear infection: washing your hands often avoiding overly crowded areas forgoing pacifiers with infants and small children breastfeeding infants avoiding secondhand smoke keeping immunizations up to date Ear infections are caused by bacteria or viruses in your middle ear, which is the part of your ear behind your eardrum. Most ear infections clear up within about 3 days, but severe infections may need to be treated with antibiotics. Ear infections are most common in children. It’s important to see a doctor if you or your child develop severe pain, a fever over 102.2°F, ear drainage, or other concerning symptoms."
362,Eating Disorders,Overview,"Although different types of eating disorders have distinct symptoms, each condition involves an extreme focus on issues related to food and eating, and some involve an extreme focus on weight. Although the term “eating” is in the name, eating disorders are about more than food. They’re complex mental health conditions that often require the intervention of medical and psychological experts to alter their course. Here are six of the most common eating disorders and their symptoms."
363,Eating Disorders,1. Anorexia nervosa,"Anorexiaoften involves: severelyrestrictedcalorie intake, which may include avoiding certain types of foods intense fear of gaining weight distorted body image It’s important to know that weight is not necessarily indicative of whether someone is living with an eating disorder. Inatypical anorexia, for example, a person may not be underweight despite experiencing significant weight loss. Anorexia is officially categorized into two subtypes: the restricting type and the binge eating and purging type. People with the restricting type lose weight solely through dieting, fasting, orexcessive exercise. People with the binge eating and purging type may binge on large amounts of food or eat very little. Purging may involve vomiting, taking laxatives or diuretics, or exercising excessively. Obsessive-compulsive symptomsare often present. For instance, many people with anorexia are preoccupied with constant thoughts about food. Some may obsessively collect recipes or hoard food. They may also have difficulty eating in public and have a strong desire to control their environment, limiting their ability to be spontaneous. Over time, people living with anorexia may experience brittle hair and nails, thinning bones, andinfertility. In severe cases, anorexia can result in heart, brain, or multi-organ failure and death."
364,Eating Disorders,2. Bulimia nervosa,"People withbulimiaoften eat large amounts of food in a limited period of time. A binge eating episode usually continues until they become painfully full. During a binge, they may feel that they cannot stop eating or control how much they are eating. Binges can happen with any type of food but most commonly occur with foods the individual would usually avoid. People with bulimia then attempt to purge to compensate for the calories consumed and to relieve gut discomfort. Common purging behaviors include: forced vomiting fasting using laxatives using diuretics using enemas excessive exercise Symptoms may appear very similar to those of the binge eating or purging subtypes of anorexia nervosa. Side effects of bulimia may include: an inflamed and sore throat swollen salivary glands worn tooth enamel tooth decay acid reflux gut irritation dehydration In severe cases, bulimia can also create animbalance in levels of electrolytes, such as sodium, potassium, and calcium. This can cause a stroke or heart attack."
365,Eating Disorders,3. Binge eating disorder (BED),"BEDoften involves eating large amounts of food rapidly, in secret, and until uncomfortably full, despite not feeling hungry. Feelings of distress, such as shame, disgust, or guilt, may occur when thinking about binge eating behavior. People with BED have symptoms similar to those of bulimia or the binge eating subtype of anorexia. This includes eating large amounts of food in relatively short periods of time and feeling a lack of control during these episodes. However, people with BED do not restrict calories or use purging behaviors, such as vomiting or excessive exercise, after a binge eating episode. People with BED may eat more ultra-processed foods than whole foods. This may increase the risk of complications such as heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes."
366,Eating Disorders,4. Pica,"Picainvolves eating things that are not considered food and that do not provide nutritional value. This may include: ice dirt soil chalk soap paper hair cloth wool pebbles laundry detergent cornstarch However, for the condition to be considered pica, the eating of non-food substances must not be a typical part of someone’s culture or religion. Pica is most frequently seen in individuals with conditions that affect daily functioning, such as: intellectual disabilities neurodevelopmental conditions, such asautism spectrum disorder mental health conditions, such asschizophrenia People with pica may have an increased risk of: poisoning infections gut injuries nutritional deficiencies Depending on the substances ingested, pica may be fatal."
367,Eating Disorders,5. Rumination disorder,"Rumination disorderoccurs when a person routinely regurgitates food they have previously chewed and swallowed, re-chews it, and then either re-swallows it or spits it out. This typically occurs within 30 minutes after a meal. In infants, rumination disorder tends to develop between 3 and 12 months old and often disappears on its own. In children and adults with the condition, therapy can resolve it. If not resolved in infants, rumination disorder can result in weight loss and severe malnutrition that can be fatal. Adults with this disorder may restrict the amount of food they eat, especially in public."
368,Eating Disorders,6. Avoidant/restrictive food intake disorder (ARFID),"People withARFIDexperience a lack of interest in eating or a distaste for certain smells, tastes, colors, textures, or temperatures. Common symptoms include: avoidance or restriction of food that prevents the person from eating enough calories or nutrients eating habits that interfere with typical social functions, such as eating with others weight loss or poor development for age and height nutrient deficienciesor dependence on supplements or tube feeding ARFID goes beyond common behaviors such as picky eating in toddlers or lower food intake in older adults. Moreover, it does not include the avoidance or restriction of foods due to lack of availability or religious or cultural practices."
369,Eating Disorders,Other eating disorders,"In addition to the six eating disorders mentioned, other less known or less common eating disorders also exist. These include: Purging disorder:People withpurging disorderuse vomiting, laxatives, diuretics, or excessive exercise to control their weight or shape. However, they do not binge eat. Night eating syndrome:People with this syndrome frequently eat excessively at night, often after awakening from sleep. Other specified feeding or eating disorder (OSFED):This is an umbrella term for conditions that have symptoms similar to those of an eating disorder but don’t fit any of the disorders above. One disorder that may currently fall under OSFED isorthorexia. Although orthorexia is increasingly mentioned in the media and in scientific studies, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th edition, text revision (DSM-5-TR) does not yet recognize it as a separate eating disorder. People with orthorexia tend to have an obsessive focus on healthy eating to an extent that disrupts their daily lives. They may compulsively check ingredient lists and nutritional labels and obsessively follow “healthy lifestyle” accounts on social media. Someone with this condition may eliminate entire food groups, fearing that they’re unhealthy. This can lead to malnutrition, severe weight loss, difficulty eating outside the home, and emotional distress."
370,Eating Disorders,The bottom line,"If these symptoms resonate with you and you think you may have an eating disorder, it’s important to reach out to a medical professional for help. Making the decision to start eating disorder recovery might feel scary or overwhelming, but seeking help from medical professionals, eating disorder recovery support groups, and your community can make recovery easier."
371,Eczema,Overview,"Eczema is a common skin condition that causes itchy, red, dry, and irritated skin. The type of eczema you have can determine what type of rash you develop and where on your body it occurs. Eczema is also called atopic dermatitis. It typically startsduring infancy or early childhoodand can persist into adulthood. However, eczema can occur in people of any age. Photo examples of the different types of eczema are shown below. Keep reading to learn more about eczema, including its causes, how to treat flares, and how to prevent them."
372,Eczema,What causes eczema?,"The cause of eczema isn’t completely understood. However, researchers think that it’s triggered by an overactive immune system. Eczema tends to flare when your skin is exposed to external irritants, which cause your immune system to overreact. We’ve listed common triggers for flare-ups below. Additionally, researchers have found that some people with eczema don’t make enough of a protein called filaggrin (filament aggregating protein). This protein is responsible for helping your skin stay moisturized and healthy. Aneczema flare-uphappens when one or more eczema symptoms appear on the skin. According to theNational Health Service (NHS), research has shown that external and internal factors can contribute to flares of eczema. Common triggers include: chemicals or preservatives found in cleansers and detergents scented products cigarette smoke external allergens such as pollens, mold, dust, or dust mites rough scratchy material, like wool synthetic fabrics sweating temperature changes stress food allergies animal dander upper respiratory infections"
373,Eczema,What are the types of eczema?,"There are a number of different types of eczema, including the following:"
374,Eczema,What are the symptoms of eczema?,"The main symptom of eczema is itchy, dry, rough, flaky, inflamed, and irritated skin. It can flare up, subside, and then flare up again. Eczema can occur anywhere but usually affects the arms, inner elbows, backs of the knees, cheeks, and scalp. It’s not contagious and sometimes becomes less severe with age. Other symptoms include: intense itching red or brownish-gray patches small, raised bumps that ooze fluid when scratched crusty patches of dried yellowish ooze, which can signal infection thickened, scaly skin sore or raw-feeling skin Many people find their symptoms get worse at night, making it difficult to sleep. Scratching eczema further irritates and inflames the skin. This can cause infections that must be treated with antibiotics. Sometimes, mild eczema can be managed at home by avoiding triggers and keeping skin moisturized. However, it’s best to see a doctor when symptoms are hard to manage or are getting worse. It’s a good idea to make a medical appointment if your: eczema isn’t responding to over-the-counter treatments symptoms are keeping you awake at night symptoms are making it hard to complete everyday tasks skin is blistering or weeping fluids skin is peeling skin is getting thick or scaly"
375,Eczema,How is eczema treated?,"Adermatologist,allergist, or primary care doctor can help you identify the correct treatment for eczema. The right treatment for you will depend on the type and severity of your eczema. You might find it helpful to combine more than one treatment. Options include: Oral over-the-counter (OTC)antihistaminescan relieve itching. They work by blocking allergic reactions triggered by histamine. However, they can cause drowsiness, so it’s best to take them when you don’t need to be alert. Examples include: cetirizine(Zyrtec) diphenhydramine (Benadryl) fexofenadine (Allegra) loratadine (Claritin) Cortisone(steroid) creams and ointments can relieve itching and scaling. But they can have side effects after long-term use, including: thinning of the skin irritation discoloration Low potency steroids, likehydrocortisone, are available OTC and can help treat mild eczema. High potency steroids for moderate orsevere eczemacan be prescribed by a doctor. A doctor might prescribeoral corticosteroidswhen topical hydrocortisone isn’t helping, These can cause serious side effects, including bone loss. To treat an infection, a doctor may prescribe a topical or oral antibiotic. Immunosuppressantsare prescription medications that prevent your immune system from overreacting. This prevents flare-ups of eczema. Side effects include an increased risk of developing cancer, infection, high blood pressure, and kidney disease. Light therapy, or phototherapy, uses ultraviolet light or sunlamps to help prevent immune system responses that trigger eczema. It requires a series of treatments and can help reduce or clear up eczema. It can also prevent bacterial skin infections. Stress can trigger symptoms or make them worse. Ways to reduce stress include: doing deep breathing exercises practicing yoga meditating listening to relaxing music prioritizing a good night’s sleep A cold compress can help alleviate itching, as can soaking for 15 to 20 minutes in a warm or lukewarm bath. Alternative treatmentsmay help calm the symptoms of eczema. Because of potential side effects, always check with your doctor before using an herbal supplement or beginning an exercise routine. Popularhome remediesinclude: green,black, oroolong tea coconut,sunflower,borage, andprimrose oils acupuncture aromatherapy relaxation techniques, like meditation, yoga, progressive muscle relaxation, or guided imagery"
376,Eczema,How is eczema diagnosed?,"There’s no specific test that can be used to diagnose eczema. Often, a doctor can diagnose the condition by talking with you about your symptoms and examining your skin. Healthcare professionals can also diagnose eczema by skin biopsy that then gets examined by a dermatopathologist. A patch test might be done to help findeczema triggers, but it’s not a diagnostic tool. A patch test can pinpoint certain allergens that trigger symptoms, like skin allergies associated with contact dermatitis During a patch test, an allergen is applied to a patch that’s placed on the skin. Your skin will become inflamed and irritated if the allergen is a trigger for you."
377,Eczema,What are the risk factors for eczema?,There are a few factors that can increase your risk of developing eczema. Eczema is more common in children who suffer fromasthmaorhay feveras well as adults who develop these conditions before age 30. People with family members who have eczema are also at higher risk of developing the condition.
378,Eczema,What are the complications of eczema?,"Eczema can lead to some complications, including: Sleep troubles.Eczema can cause difficulty sleeping and disrupt yoursleep hygiene. Skin infections.Repeated scratching can leave your skin open to bacteria and viruses that can cause infections. Asthma and hay fever.Eczema can often lead to developingasthmaorhay fever,especially in children younger than age 12. Thick and scaly skin.Scratching can cause your skin to harden and thicken over time. Additional types of eczema.Often, having one type of eczema can increase your risk of another developing."
379,Eczema,How is eczema prevented?,"You can take steps to prevent eczema flare-ups. You and your doctor can discuss some of the changes that might work best for you. Common steps toprevent flare-upsinclude: reducing stress avoiding known triggers keeping skin clean reducing shower or bath times to 10 minutes or less avoiding very hot shower or bath water keeping skin moisturized using dye and scent-free laundry, bath, and makeup products taking any prescriptions as directed avoiding itching skin"
380,Eczema,What’s the outlook for eczema?,"There’s no cure for eczema, but you can effectively manage symptoms with the right treatments. Treatment might include a combination of lifestyle changes and medications. In some cases, eczema can cause additional health complications such as infections, asthma, or worsening skin. Fortunately, finding the right treatments can help prevent complications. Talk with a doctor if you’re having trouble managing eczema or if your symptoms have been getting worse. They can help you find a treatment plan that works for you and reduces your flare-ups."
381,Endometriosis,Overview,"The cause of endometriosis is unknown, but it occurs when endometrial-like tissue grows outside of the uterine cavity. It can cause painful symptoms that may get worse with hormone fluctuations."
382,Endometriosis,What is endometriosis?,"Endometriosis is a disorder in which tissue similar to the lining of your uterusgrows outside of your uterine cavity. The lining of your uterus is called theendometrium. In endometriosis, endometrial-like tissuecan growon the: ovaries fallopian tubes tissues holding the uterus in place outer surface of the uterus The hormonal changes of your menstrual cycleaffectthe misplaced endometrial-like tissue, causing the area to become inflamed and painful. This tissue cannot easily get out of your body. This tisssue may also continue to expand, which can cause problemssuch as: irritation cysts scar formation adhesions, in which tissue binds your pelvic organs together bladder and intestine problems"
383,Endometriosis,Endometriosis symptoms,"The symptoms of endometriosis vary. Some people experience mild symptoms, but others can have moderate to severe symptoms. The severity of your pain does not indicate the degree or stage of the condition. You may have a mild form of the disease yet experience agonizing pain. It’s also possible to have a severe form and have very little discomfort. It’s also important to note that you may not experience any symptoms. Pelvic pain is the most common symptom of endometriosis. You may also have thefollowing symptoms: painful menstrual cramps bleeding between periods infertility pain during or after sexual intercourse painful bowel movements pain when urinating during periods It is important that you get regular gynecological exams, which will allow your gynecologist to monitor any changes. This is particularly important if you have two or more symptoms. If you don’t already have an OBGYN, you can browse doctors in your area through theHealthline FindCare tool."
384,Endometriosis,Endometriosis treatment,"Endometriosis has no cure, but its symptoms can be managed. Medical and surgical options are available to help reduce your symptoms and manage any potential complications. Your doctor may first try conservative treatments. They may then recommend surgery if your condition does not improve. Everyone reacts differently to these treatment options. Your doctor will help you find the one that works best for you. Pain medications for endometriosis can include non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) andover-the-counter pain medicationssuch as ibuprofen. You should always check with your doctor before starting any new medications, even if they are OTC. Taking supplemental hormones canrelieve painandstop the progressionof endometriosis. Hormone therapy helps your body regulate the monthly hormonal changes that promote the tissue growth that occurs with endometriosis. Keep in mind that some forms of hormone therapymay not be suitableif you are planning to get pregnant. Hormonal contraceptives decrease fertility by preventing the monthly growth and buildup of endometrial-like tissue. They may decrease pain and bleeding. Contraceptivescan include: birth control pills patches vaginal rings The medroxyprogesterone (Depo-Provera) injection is also effective in stopping menstruation. It stops the growth of endometrial implants. It relieves pain and other symptoms. This may not be your first choice, however, due to side effectssuch as: weight gain decreased bone mineral density vaginal cysts Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists and antagonistsblockthe menstrual cycle and lower the amount of estrogen your body makes. Estrogenis the hormone that’s mainly responsible for the development of sexual characteristics in people assigned female at birth. Blocking the production of estrogen prevents menstruation and creates artificial menopause. GnRH therapy hasside effectslike hot flashes and weight gain. Taking small doses of estrogen and progesterone at the same time canhelp to limit or preventthese symptoms. Danazol is another medication used to stop menstruation and help reduce symptoms of endometriosis. However, it does not prevent disease progression. Danazol cancause side effects, includingacneandhirsutism. Hirsutism is excessive hair growth on your face and body. Other drugs are being studied that may improve symptoms and slow disease progression. Conservative surgery is typically used for people who want to get pregnant or who experience severe pain and hormonal treatments are not working. The goal of conservative surgery is to remove or destroy endometrial growths without damaging the reproductive organs. Laparoscopy, a minimally invasive surgery, is used to both visualize and diagnose endometriosis. It is also used to remove the abnormal or displaced endometrial-like tissue. A surgeon makes small incisions in the abdomen to surgically remove the growths or to burn or vaporize them. Lasers are now commonly used to destroy this “out of place” tissue. Your doctor may recommend a totalhysterectomyas a last resort if your conditiondoes not improvewith other treatments. During a total hysterectomy, a surgeonremovesthe uterus and cervix. They also remove the ovaries because these organs make estrogen, and estrogen can cause the growth of endometrial-like tissue. Additionally, the surgeon removes visible implant lesions. Two other types of hysterectomies are performed based on the condition a person is being treated for. Asubtotal— also referred to as partial or supracervical — hysterectomy removes the upper part of the uterus, leaving the cervix in place. Aradical hysterectomyis typically performed when cancer is present. It removes the entire uterus, cervix, and the top part of the vagina. You’ll be unable to get pregnant after a hysterectomy. If you’re thinking about starting a family, get a second medical opinion before agreeing to surgery. Keep in mind that you maystill feel painassociated with endometriosis after a hysterectomy. Getting a diagnosis and starting treatment options early in the disease can be challenging. Thinking about — or coping with — symptoms like fertility issues and pain coupled with fear possibly setting in about getting relief can be stressful. In addition to your treatments, it’s important to address your mental wellness. You may consider finding a support group or starting therapy. Taking these steps can help you create a well-balanced approach to managing your condition."
385,Endometriosis,What causes endometriosis?,"The exact cause of endometriosis isn’t known. There areseveral theoriesregarding the cause, although no one theory has been scientifically proven. One of themost likely theoriesis that endometriosis occurs due to a process called retrograde menstruation. This occurs when menstrual blood flows back through your fallopian tubes into your pelvic cavity instead of leaving your body through the vagina. Another theory is that the immune system mayfail to find and destroyendometrial-like tissue growing outside of the uterus. It’s also possible that endometrial-like tissue may bepicked up and moved by mistakeduring surgery, such as after acesarean delivery, also commonly called a C-section. Some believe endometriosis might start in the fetal period with misplaced cell tissue that begins to respond to the hormones of puberty. This is often calledMullerian theory. The development of endometriosis might also be linked togeneticsor evenenvironmental toxins."
386,Endometriosis,Endometriosis stages,"Endometriosis hasfour stagesor types: minimal mild moderate severe Different factors determine the stage of the disorder. These factors can include the location, number, size, and depth of endometrial implants. In minimal endometriosis, there are small lesions or wounds and shallow endometrial implants on your ovaries. Mild endometriosis involves more and deeper implants on the ovaries and the pelvic lining compared to the minimal stage. Moderate endometriosis involves many deep implants on your ovaries and pelvic lining. There can also be adhesions or small cysts. The most severe stage of endometriosis involves many deep implants and dense adhesions on your pelvic lining and ovaries. There can also be cysts on one or both of your ovaries."
387,Endometriosis,Diagnosis,"The symptoms of endometriosis can be similar to the symptoms of other conditions, such as ovarian cysts and pelvic inflammatory disease. The condition also shares similar symptoms withirritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which can prolong diagnosis. At the core of treating your pain is getting an accurate diagnosis. It’s important to note that the diagnosis process may vary. In some situations, it can take4 to 11 yearsfrom the onset of symptoms to diagnosis. Try to be patient with yourself and the process as you work with your healthcare team. Your doctor will perform one or more of the following tests: Your doctor will note your symptoms and personal or family history of endometriosis. A general health assessment may also be performed to determine if there are any other signs of a long-term disorder. During apelvic exam, your doctor will use a speculum and light to see inside of the vagina and cervix. They will also manually feel your abdomen for cysts or scars behind the uterus. Your doctor may use atransvaginal ultrasoundor anabdominal ultrasound. In a transvaginal ultrasound, a probe is inserted into your vagina. Both types of ultrasound provide images of your reproductive organs. They can help your doctor identify cysts associated with endometriosis, but they aren’t effective in ruling out the disease. The only certain method for identifying endometriosis is by viewing it directly. This is done by a minor surgical procedure known aslaparoscopy. Once diagnosed, the tissue can be removed in the same procedure."
388,Endometriosis,Endometriosis complications,"Although there are medications used to treat endometriosis, they do not improve fertility. You may be able to conceive after having endometrial-like tissue surgically removed. If this does not work in your case, you may want to considerfertility treatmentsorin vitro fertilizationto help improve your chances of having a baby. Talk with your doctor to better understand your options, such as if endometriosis will affect your timeline for starting a family. They may advise you to start sooner or delay the pregnancy. With endometriosis, your symptoms may worsen over time, which can make it difficult to naturally conceive. Your doctor will need to do an assessment before and during your pregnancy. Moreover, if you have endometriosis, you may be at anincreased riskof various pregnancy complications."
389,Endometriosis,Risk factors,"Endometriosis can developanytime after the startof your menstrual cycle. Understanding its risk factors can help you determine whether you’re more likely to develop this condition and when you should talk with your doctor. Women of all ages are at risk for endometriosis. It mostcommonly affects womenin their 30s and 40s, but symptomscan begin at puberty. Talk with your doctor if you have a family member who has endometriosis. You may have ahigher riskof developing the disease. Pregnancymay temporarily decreasethe symptoms of endometriosis, but it is not a cure. Women who have not had children are at anincreased riskof developing the disorder. However, endometriosis can still occur in women who’ve had children. You may be at ahigher riskfor developing endometriosis if you have short menstrual cycles (27 days or fewer) or periods that last for more than seven days."
390,Endometriosis,Race and ethnicity research data,"While endometriosis affects about11 percent of Americanwomen between 15 and 44 years old, a2019 studyfound that race and ethnicity may influence its prevalence. When compared with white women, Hispanic and Black women are less likely to receive a diagnosis for endometriosis. Alternately, Asian women were 50 percent more likely to receive a diagnosis when compared with white women. However, areview published in 2019found that when results were limited to women with infertility, disparities for Black women were reduced; there was no statistical significance between Black, white, and Asian patients. The researchers argued that it is unknown if previous associations were made based on diagnostic biases or other factors. Additionally, there is a lack of research that examines prevalence and outcomes inAmerican IndianorAlaskan Native women. Overall, more inclusive research that factors in environmental and socioeconomic factors and access to healthcare is necessary to better understand the disease."
391,Endometriosis,Takeaway,"Endometriosis is a chronic condition. Its cause has yet to be determined, and currently, it does not have a cure. However, effective treatments, such as medications, hormone therapy, and surgery, are available to help manage its side effects and complications like pain and fertility issues. It’s important to immediately contact your doctor if you feel you might have endometriosis. They can begin the process of getting an accurate diagnosis and eventually creating a plan based on your specific situation."
392,Epilepsy,Overview,"Epilepsy is a brain condition characterized by unprovoked, recurring seizures that are caused by sudden bursts of electrical activity in the brain. Focal seizures may cause brief changes in senses or awareness, while generalized seizures can cause jerky movements, falling, and loss of consciousness, among other symptoms. Epilepsy usually begins in young children and older adults. It’s typically diagnosed when a person experiences at least two seizures with no identifiable cause. But some risk factors include head trauma, illness, infections, stroke, brain tumors, dementia, and neurological diseases. There’s currently no cure for epilepsy, but treatments like medication, vagus nerve stimulation, dietary changes, and surgery can help manage the condition and improve quality of life."
393,Epilepsy,Epilepsy definition,"Epilepsy is a neurological condition that causes unprovoked, recurrent seizures. A seizure is a sudden rush of abnormal electrical activity in your brain. Doctors diagnose epilepsy when you have two or more seizures with no other identifiable cause. Epilepsy affects50 millionpeople around the world, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) and nearly3.5 millionpeople in the United States, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Anyone can develop epilepsy, but itmost commonlyonsets in young children and older adults. According toresearch published in 2021, men develop epilepsy more often than women, possibly because of higher exposure to risk factors like alcohol use and head trauma. The two maintypes of seizuresare: generalized seizures focal seizures Generalized seizures affect your whole brain. Focal, or partial seizures, affect only one part of your brain. A mild seizure may be difficult to recognize. It may only last a few seconds, and you may remain awake while it happens. Stronger seizures can cause spasms and uncontrollable muscle twitches. They can last from a few seconds to several minutes and may cause confusion or loss of consciousness. Afterward, you may have no memory of a seizure happening. There’s currently no cure for epilepsy, but it can be managed with medications and other strategies."
394,Epilepsy,What are the symptoms of epilepsy?,"Seizures are the main symptom of epilepsy. Symptoms differ from person to person and according to the type of seizure. A focal aware seizure (previously calledsimple partial seizure) does not involve loss of consciousness. Symptoms include: alterations to sense of taste, smell, sight, hearing, or touch dizziness tingling and twitching of limbs Focal unaware seizures (previously calledcomplex partial seizures) involve loss of awareness or consciousness. Other symptoms include: staring blankly unresponsiveness performing repetitive movements Generalized seizuresinvolve the whole brain. Subtypes include: Absence seizures.Absence seizuresused to be called “petit mal seizures.” They tend to cause a short loss of awareness, a blank stare, and may cause repetitive movements like lip smacking or blinking. Tonic seizures.Tonic seizures cause sudden stiffness in the muscles in your legs, arms, or trunk. Atonic seizures.Atonic seizures lead to loss of muscle control. They’re also called “drop seizures” because a sudden loss of muscle strength can make you fall suddenly. Clonic seizures.Clonic seizures are characterized by repeated, jerky muscle movements of the face, neck, and arms. Myoclonic seizures.Myoclonic seizurescause spontaneous quick twitching of the arms and legs. Sometimes these seizures cluster together. Tonic-clonic seizures.Tonic-clonic seizuresused to be called “grand mal seizures.” Symptoms include:stiffening of the bodyshakingloss of bladder or bowel controlbiting of the tongueloss of consciousness stiffening of the body shaking loss of bladder or bowel control biting of the tongue loss of consciousness Following a seizure, you may not remember having one, or you might feel slightly ill for a few hours. Learn more about epilepsy symptoms."
395,Epilepsy,First aid for seizures,"It’s important to note that most seizures don’t require emergency medical attention, and you can’t stop a seizure once it’s in progress. When you’re with somebody having a mild seizure: Stay with the person until their seizure ends and they’re awake. Once they’re awake, guide them to a safe place and tell them what happen. Stay calm and try to keep other people calm. Speak calmly. Check for a medical bracelet. Offer to help the person get home safely. If the person is having a tonic-clonic seizure, which causes uncontrolled shaking or jerking: Ease the person to the ground. Turn them gently onto their side to help them breathe. Clear any dangerous objects away from them. Put something soft under their head. If they wear glasses, remove them. Loosen any clothing, such as a tie, that may affect breathing. Time the seizure and call 911 if it lasts longer than5 minutes. When someone is having a seizure, it’s critical tonever: hold the person down or try to stop their movements put anything in their mouth give them mouth to mouth offer the person food or water until they’re fully alert Learn more about epilepsy first aid."
396,Epilepsy,What causes epilepsy?,"In abouthalf of people with epilepsy, the cause cannot be determined, per the WHO. A variety of factors can contribute to the development of seizures, such as: traumatic brain injury or other head trauma brain scarring after a brain injury (post-traumatic epilepsy) serious illness or very high fever stroke, which causesabout halfof epilepsy cases in older adults when there’s no identifiable cause, according to the CDC lack of oxygen to the brain brain tumoror cyst dementia, includingAlzheimer’s disease maternal use of some drugs, prenatal injury, brain malformation, or lack of oxygen at birth infectious conditions likeHIV and AIDSandmeningitis genetic or developmental disorders or neurological diseases Epilepsy can develop at any age, but diagnosis usually occurs inearly childhood or after 60 years old."
397,Epilepsy,Is epilepsy hereditary?,"Researchers first identified genes linked to epilepsy in thelate 1990s, according to the Epilepsy Foundation. Since then, they have discovered more than500 genesthought to contribute to its development. Some genes are associated with certain types of epilepsy. For example, people with Dravet syndrome often have abnormal changes in theirSCN1Agene. Not all genes linked to epilepsy are passed down through families. Some gene mutations develop in children even if they’re not present in either parent. These are called “de novo mutations.” Some types of epilepsy are more common in people with a family history, but most children of people with epilepsy don’t develop epilepsy themselves. According to the Epilepsy Foundation, even if a child has a parent or sibling with epilepsy, the chances that they’ll develop the condition by age 40 is stillless than 5 percent. The chances of developing epilepsy are higher if a close relative has a generalized epilepsy rather than a focal epilepsy. If your parent has epilepsy due to another cause, such as stroke or brain injury, it does not affect your chances of developing seizures. Certain rare conditions, such astuberous sclerosisand neurofibromatosis, can cause seizures. These conditions can run in families. Genetics may also make some people more susceptible to seizures from environmental triggers. If you have epilepsy and are concerned about starting a family, consider arranging a consultation with a genetic counselor."
398,Epilepsy,What triggers an epileptic seizure?,"Some people identify things or situations that trigger their seizures. A few of the most common known triggers are: lack of sleep illness or fever stress bright lights, flashing lights, or patterns caffeine, alcohol or alcohol withdrawal, medications, or illegal drugs skipping meals, overeating, or specific food ingredients very low blood sugar head injury Identifying triggers isn’t always easy. A single incident doesn’t always mean something is a trigger. Often, a combination of factors triggers a seizure. A good way to find your triggers is to keep a seizure journal. After each seizure, note the following: day and time what activity you were involved in what was happening around you unusual sights, smells, or sounds unusual stressors what you were eating or how long it had been since you’d eaten your level of fatigue and how well you slept the night before You can also use your seizure journal to determine if your medications are working. Note how you felt just before and just after your seizure, and any side effects. Bring the journal with you when you visit the doctor. It may be useful for your doctor if adjusting your medications or exploring other treatments is, or becomes, necessary."
399,Epilepsy,Potential complications of epilepsy,"Epileptic seizures disrupt the electrical activity of your brain, which can directly or indirectly affect many parts of your body. Potential complications of epilepsy include: learning difficulty (about20 percentof people with epilepsy have an intellectual disability, according to a 2018 research article) injury from falling during a seizure injury while operating an automobile or machinery depression brain damage from prolonged and uncontrolled seizures choking on food or saliva medication side effects Each year, about1.16 out of every 1,000 peoplewith epilepsy experience sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP), according to the CDC. SUDEP is an epilepsy-related death not caused by drowning, injury, or another known cause. Pauses in breathing, airway obstruction, and abnormal heart rhythm are thought to contribute. SUDEP is more common in people with epilepsy that is not well managed. Taking all your medication as prescribed and visiting your doctor regularly can help you minimize your risk. Learn more about the effects of epilepsy on your body."
400,Epilepsy,How is epilepsy diagnosed?,"If you suspect you’ve had a seizure, see a doctor as soon as possible. A seizure can be a symptom of a serious medical issue. Your medical history and symptoms will help your doctor decide which tests will be helpful. They’ll likely give you a neurological examination to test your motor abilities and mental functioning. To diagnose epilepsy, other conditions that cause seizures should be ruled out. A doctor will probably order acomplete blood count (CBC)and chemistry of your blood. Blood tests may be used to look for: signs of infectious diseases liver and kidney function blood glucose levels Electroencephalogram (EEG)is the most common test used to diagnose epilepsy. It’s a noninvasive and painless test that involves placing electrodes on your scalp to search for abnormal patterns in your brain’s electrical activity. You may be asked to perform a specific task during the test. In some cases, the test is performed while you sleep. Imaging tests can reveal tumors and other abnormalities that can cause seizures. These tests might include: CT scan MRI positron emission tomography (PET) single-photon emission computerized tomography Epilepsy is usually diagnosed if you have seizures, but there’s no apparent or reversible cause."
401,Epilepsy,How is epilepsy treated?,"Treatment for epilepsy may help you have fewer seizures or stop seizures completely. Your treatment plan will be based on: the severity of your symptoms your health how well you respond to therapy Some treatment options include: Anti-epileptic (anticonvulsant, antiseizure) drugs.Anti-epileptic medicationscan help reduce the number of seizures you have. In some people, they may eliminate seizures. To be most effective, the medication must be taken exactly as your doctor prescribed. Vagus nerve stimulator.This deviceis surgically placed under the skin on your chest and electrically stimulates the nerve that runs through your neck to prevent seizures. Ketogenic diet.According to the Epilepsy Foundation,more than halfof children who do not respond to medications benefit from theketogenic diet, which is a high fat and low carbohydrate diet. Brain surgery.The area of the brain that causes seizure activity can beremoved or alteredif you and your healthcare team determine it’s the right treatment for your condition. Research into new treatments is ongoing. One treatment that may be more widely available in the future is deep brain stimulation. It involves implanting electrodes into your brain and a generator into your chest. The generator sends electrical impulses to your brain to help decrease seizures. The FDA approved the use of deep brain stimulation in2018in people over 18 years old with focal onset seizures who have not responded to at least three anti-epileptic medications. Minimally invasive surgeries and radiosurgery are also being investigated."
402,Epilepsy,Medications for epilepsy,"The first-line treatment for epilepsy is antiseizure medication. These drugs are designed to help reduce the frequency and severity of seizures. They cannot stop a seizure that’s already in progress, and they are not a cure for epilepsy. These medications are absorbed by your stomach. They then travel through your bloodstream to your brain. They affect neurotransmitters in a way that reduces the electrical activity that leads to seizures. There are many antiseizure drugs on the market. Your doctor can prescribe a single drug or a combination of drugs, depending on your type of seizure. Common epilepsy medications include: levetiracetam (Keppra) lamotrigine(Lamictal) topiramate(Topamax) valproic acid (Depakote) carbamazepine(Tegretol) ethosuximide(Zarontin) These medications are generally available in tablet, liquid, or injectable forms and are taken once or twice a day. Your doctor will initially prescribe the lowest possible dose, which can be adjusted until it starts to work. These medications must be taken consistently and as prescribed. Some potential side effects may include: fatigue dizziness skin rash poor coordination memory problems Rare, but serious side effects include depression and inflammation of the liver or other organs. Epilepsy is different for everybody, but in most cases, people see improvement with antiseizure medication. Some children with epilepsy may stop having seizures and can stop taking medication. Learn more about the medications used to treat epilepsy."
403,Epilepsy,Is surgery an option for epilepsy management?,"If medication can’t decrease your number of seizures, another option isbrain surgery. The most common surgery is resection. This involves removing the part of your brain where the seizures start. Most often, the temporal lobe is removed in a procedure known as temporal lobectomy. In some cases, this can stop seizure activity. In some cases, you’ll be kept awake during this surgery so doctors can talk with you and avoid removing part of the brain that controls important functions such as vision, hearing, speech, or movement. If the area of the brain is too big or important to remove, surgeons may perform another procedure called a multiple subpial transection, or disconnection. During this procedure, the surgeon makes cuts in your brain to interrupt the nerve pathway. This cut keeps seizures from spreading to other areas of your brain. After surgery, some people are able to cut down on antiseizure medications or even stop taking them, their doctor’s oversight. There are risks to any surgery, including a negative reaction to anesthesia, bleeding, and infection. Surgery of the brain can sometimes result in cognitive changes. It can be a good idea to discuss the pros and cons of the different procedures with your surgeon and other healthcare team members. You may also want to seek a second opinion before making a final decision. Learn more about surgery for epilepsy."
404,Epilepsy,When to contact a doctor,"It’s important to see your doctor regularly for checkups. People with well-managed epilepsy should consider meeting with their family doctor or epilepsy specialist at leastonce per year, according to the National Health Service. People with epilepsy that is not well managed may need to see their doctor more often. It’s also a good idea to schedule an appointment with your doctor if you experience any new symptoms or if you experience side effects after your medication has been changed."
405,Epilepsy,Living with epilepsy: What to expect,"Epilepsy is a chronic disorder that can affect many parts of your life. Laws vary from state to state, but if your seizures are not well managed, you may not be allowed to drive. Because you never know when a seizure will occur, many everyday activities like crossing a busy street can become dangerous. These problems can lead to loss of independence. In addition to regular doctor visits and following your treatment plan, here are some things you can do to cope: Keep a seizure diary to help identify possible triggers so you can avoid them. Wear a medical alert bracelet to let people know that you have epilepsy so you get the right medical help if you have a seizure and can’t speak. Teach the people closest to you about seizures and what to do in an emergency. Seek professional help if you have — or think you have — symptoms of depression or anxiety. Join a support group for people with seizure disorders. Engage in health-promoting activities like eating a nutrient-rich, balanced diet and getting regular exercise. Learn more about living with epilepsy."
406,Epilepsy,Is there a cure for epilepsy?,"Early treatment with medication can help reduce seizure frequency and the chances of serious complications. Epilepsy surgery, meanwhile, is considered curative in most cases. Approximately30 percentof people with partial epilepsy and 25 percent of people with generalized epilepsy have seizures that don’t respond well to medication. If medication fails, your doctor may recommend surgery or vagus nerve stimulation. Two types of brain surgery can cut down on or eliminate seizures. One type, called resection, involves removing the part of the brain where seizures originate. When the area of the brain responsible for seizures is too vital or large to remove, the surgeon can perform a disconnection. This involves interrupting the nerve pathway by making cuts in the brain. This keeps seizures from spreading to other parts of the brain. Dozens of other avenues of research into the causes, treatment, and potential cures for epilepsy are ongoing. Although there’s no cure at this time, the right treatment can result in a dramatic improvement in your condition and your quality of life.

The muscles you use to do this are your pelvic floor muscles. Now that you know where these muscles are, contract them for 3 seconds. Then release them. Repeat this exercise 10 to 20 times in a row, three times per day. A small2005 studycompared two groups of men with ED. The first group of men performed regular pelvic floor muscle exercises with a physiotherapist. They also receivedbiofeedbackand advice on lifestyle changes. The second group only received advice on lifestyle changes. Men in the first group saw their penile function improve significantly after 3 months of regular pelvic floor muscle exercises. Men in the second group saw little improvement after 3 months. For the next 3 months, all participants were given at-home exercises to perform. After 6 months in total, 40% of all participants, including some men who had belonged to the second group, had regained normal erectile function. A2019 literature reviewalso concluded that pelvic floor exercises were effective at treating both ED and premature ejaculation. However, the researchers didn’t identify an ideal exercise plan in terms of conditions such as frequency and intensity. You may find that it’s easier initially to do Kegels while lying down.

If your pain is mild, one option is to take over-the-counter pain relievers, such as: acetaminophen (Tylenol) aspirin ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) These medications can lower your pain levels, reduce discomfort, and help you better manage your condition. They may even help you sleep better. Many of them bring down inflammation, too. Though inflammation is not a primary symptom of fibromyalgia, you may experience it if you have a related condition such as rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Please note that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) do haveside effects. Caution is advised if NSAIDs are used for an extended period, as is usually the case when you’re managing a chronic pain condition. Opioidshave also been prescribed for pain relief. However,researchhas not shown them to be effective over time. Also, the dosage for narcotics is typically increased rapidly, which can pose a health risk for people prescribed these drugs. Tramadol(Ultram) is one of the opioids most closely associated with fibromyalgia relief. However, someexpertsdo not consider it a traditional opioid, and any possible benefits for fibromyalgia could be due to it also being aserotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). According to a2020 study, there’s not enough evidence to support or oppose the use of tramadol in fibromyalgia. More research on opioids is needed. Pregabalin(Lyrica), an antiseizure drug, was the first medication the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for fibromyalgia. It blocks nerve cells from sending out pain signals. Gabapentin(Neurontin) was designed to treat epilepsy, but it may also help reduce symptoms in people with fibromyalgia. Gabapentin has not been FDA-approved to treat fibromyalgia and is considered anoff-label drug. Off-label drug use means a drug that’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for one purpose is used for a different purpose that has not yet been approved. However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So your doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care. Antidepressants such asduloxetine(Cymbalta) and milnacipran (Savella) are sometimes used to treat pain and fatigue from fibromyalgia. These medications may also work on rebalancingneurotransmittersand help improve sleep. The FDA has approved both duloxetine and milnacipran for the treatment of fibromyalgia. Other drugs that are not FDA-approved to treat fibromyalgia, such as sleep aids, can help with specific symptoms. Muscle relaxers, which were once used, are no longer recommended. Researchers are also investigating a few experimental treatments that may help people with fibromyalgia in the future."
433,Fibromyalgia,Natural remedies for fibromyalgia,"If medications do not relieve your symptoms entirely, you can look for alternatives. Many natural remedies focus on lowering stress and reducing pain, and they can help you feel better both mentally and physically. You can use them alone or together with traditional medical treatments. Natural remedies for fibromyalgiainclude: occupational and physical therapy, which improves your strength and reduces stress on your body acupuncture massage therapy meditation yoga, which you should approach with caution if you havehypermobility tai chi exercise stress-reduction techniques a balanced, nutrient-rich diet 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP), an amino acid Therapy can potentially reduce the stress that triggers fibromyalgia symptoms. Group therapy may bethe most affordable option, and it can give you a chance to meet others who are going through the same issues. Individual therapy is also available if you prefer one-on-one help.Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)is one approach for managing stressful situations. If you’ve been diagnosed with fibromyalgia, try to eat a balanced diet overall. Nutritious foods provide you with a constant energy supply and help you keep your body healthy. They may also help prevent symptoms from getting worse. Avoiding certain foods can be beneficial in helping you manage your condition.Check out these 10 fibromyalgia-friendly recipes if you need ideas for what to eat. It’s important to note that most alternative treatments for fibromyalgia have not been thoroughly studied or proven effective. Ask a healthcare professional about the benefits and risks before trying some of these treatments."
434,Fibromyalgia,Fibromyalgia causes,"Healthcare professionals and researchers do not knowwhat causes fibromyalgia. According to the latest research, the cause appears to involve a genetic disposition complemented by one or more triggers (such as infection, trauma, or stress). Expertsdo not fully understandwhat causes the chronic widespread nature of fibromyalgia pain, either. One theory is that the brain lowers the pain threshold. Sensations that were not painful before become very painful over time. Another theory is that the brain and nerves may misinterpret or overreact to normal pain signals. They become more sensitive, to the point where they cause unnecessary or exaggerated pain. This may be due to achemical imbalance in the brainor an abnormality in the dorsal root ganglion, which is a cluster ofneuronsin the spine. Fibromyalgia often runs in families. If you have a family member with this condition, you’re at a higher risk for developing it. Researchersthink certain gene mutations may play a role. They’ve identified a few possible genes that affect the transmission of chemical pain signals between nerve cells. A past illness could trigger fibromyalgia or make its symptoms worse. Infections that have possible links to fibromyalgia include: flu pneumonia Epstein-Barr virus gastrointestinal infections, such as those caused by the bacteriaSalmonellaandShigella People who go through severe physical or emotional trauma may develop fibromyalgia. The condition has been linked topost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Like trauma,stresscan have long-lasting effects on your body. Stress has been linked to hormonal changes that could contribute to fibromyalgia."
435,Fibromyalgia,Fibromyalgia risk factors,"Available research still has not identified an exact cause of fibromyalgia. Factors that may increase your risk of developing it include: Sex.Most fibromyalgia cases are currently diagnosed in females, but the reason for this disparity is not clear. Age.You’re most likely to be diagnosed in middle age, and your risk increases as you get older. Children can develop fibromyalgia too. Family history.If you have close family members with fibromyalgia, you may be at greater risk for developing it. A history of other conditions.Although fibromyalgia is not a form of arthritis, havingrheumatoid arthritis (RA)may increase your risk of also having fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia also affectsaround 30 percentof people withlupus. Research continues to evolve to better understand this condition and its origin."
436,Fibromyalgia,Fibromyalgia diagnosis,"Ahealthcare professionalmay diagnose you with fibromyalgia if you’ve had widespread painfor 3 months or longerin four out of five specific regions. “Widespread” means the pain is on both sides of your body, and you feel it above and below your waist. After a thorough examination, they must conclude that no other condition is causing your pain. Healthcare professionals typically use a process of elimination to diagnose fibromyalgia. There are no imaging scans that can detect it. However, a healthcare professional may use imaging scans or various blood tests to help rule out other possible causes of your chronic pain. The FM/a test is ablood testthat may be used to diagnose fibromyalgia. The manufacturers of the test claim that it’s definitive, butother experts are more skepticalof its usefulness. It detects the presence of chemokine and cytokine proteins.Find out more about how fibromyalgia is diagnosed. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
437,Fibromyalgia,Fibromyalgia tender points,"In the past, a person was diagnosed with fibromyalgia if they had widespread pain and tenderness inat least 11 out of 18 specific pointsaround their body. Healthcare professionals would check to see how many of these points were painful by pressing firmly on them. Common tender points, or trigger points, included the: back of the head tops of the shoulders upper chest outer elbows hips knees For the most part, tender points are no longer a part of the diagnostic process. Instead, healthcare professionals may diagnose fibromyalgia if you’ve had pain in four out of the five areas of pain as defined by the2016 revised diagnostic criteria, and you have no other diagnosable medical condition that could explain the pain.Learn more about fibromyalgia tender points."
438,Fibromyalgia,Fibromyalgia and autoimmunity,"Inautoimmune diseasessuch asRAandlupus, the body mistakenly targets its own tissues. The immune system uses proteins called autoantibodies to attack the joints or other healthy tissues in the same way it would normally attack viruses or bacteria. Having a small number of autoantibodies is normal, but high levels may indicate an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases and fibromyalgia have some overlapping symptoms, such as fatigue and trouble concentrating. It can be hard for healthcare professionals to determine whether you have an autoimmune disease or fibromyalgia. You can even have both types of conditions simultaneously. The overlap in symptoms has led to the theory that fibromyalgia could also be an autoimmune disease. This claim has been hard to prove, partly because there’s been little to no evidence that autoantibodies are involved in fibromyalgia. Fibromyalgia does not traditionally cause inflammation, either. Inflammation is a common symptom of autoimmune diseases. However, a small2021 studyfound that autoantibodies may contribute to fibromyalgia after all. In the study, researchers injected mice with autoantibodies from people with fibromyalgia or people without fibromyalgia. The mice injected with autoantibodies from people with fibromyalgia began to experience fibromyalgia-like symptoms, such as reduced muscular strength and greater sensitivity to painful sensations (like cold). The mice injected with autoantibodies from healthy people did not have any symptoms. A different2021 study from Taiwanhas pointed to a link between fibromyalgia and the inflammatory autoimmune diseaseSjögren’s disease. People with fibromyalgia were twice as likely to develop Sjögren’s as people without fibromyalgia, according to data collected between 2000 and 2012. More research is needed, but these study results are encouraging. If fibromyalgia is an autoimmune disease, treatments for autoimmune diseases could potentially help treat fibromyalgia, too.Learn more about the relationship between fibromyalgia and autoimmune diseases."
439,Fibromyalgia,Fibromyalgia in females,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), fibromyalgia istwice as commonin women as it is in men. Research has traditionally concluded thatat least 80 to 90 percentof fibromyalgia cases are diagnosed in women, according to a 2018 study on bias in fibromyalgia diagnosis. Fibromyalgia may be underdiagnosed in men, though. Fibromyalgia symptoms have generally been more severe in people who are female than in people who are male. People assigned female at birth have more widespread pain,symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and morning fatigue than people assigned male at birth.Painful periodsare also common. In addition, the transition to menopause could make fibromyalgia worse. Complicating matters is the fact that some symptoms of menopause and fibromyalgia look almost identical.Learn more about how fibromyalgia affects people assigned female at birth."
440,Fibromyalgia,Fibromyalgia in males,"Males can have fibromyalgia, but they may remain undiagnosed because it’s viewed as a predominantly female disease. When the 2016 diagnostic criteria are applied, more men are diagnosed, according to the2018 study on bias. The conventional wisdom is that at least 80 to 90 percent of fibromyalgia cases affect women. When data from a German study were reanalyzed, researchers found that women comprised only 59.2 percent of the fibromyalgia cases. This means men comprised 40.8 percent of the cases. Males with fibromyalgia may have severe pain and emotional symptoms. The condition may affect their quality of life, career, and relationships, according to a2018 survey. Part of the stigma and difficulty in getting diagnosed stems from society’s expectation that males who are in pain should “suck it up.” Those who do see a doctor can face emotional discomfort and the chance that their complaints will not be taken seriously."
441,Fibromyalgia,Living with fibromyalgia,"Your quality of life can be affected when you live with pain, fatigue, and other symptoms on a daily basis. Complicating matters are the misunderstandings many people have about fibromyalgia. Because your symptoms are hard to see, it may be easy for those around you todismiss your pain as imaginary. Know that your condition is real. Be persistent in your pursuit of a treatment that works for you. Before you start to feel better, you may need to try more than one therapy or use a few techniques in combination. Lean on people who understand what you’re going through, such as your doctor, close friends, or therapist. Be gentle with yourself. Try not to overdo it. Most importantly, have faith that you can learn to cope with and manage your condition."
442,Flu,Overview,"The flu is a contagious viral infection that can cause symptoms ranging from sneezing and muscle aches to fever, and it’s most prevalent during the fall and winter. You can manage most flu cases at home by resting, drinking fluids, and using over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms, but antiviral prescriptions are available for severe cases or those at high risk. Getting an annual flu vaccine is the most effective way to prevent the flu and reduce the severity of symptoms if you do get sick; it’s recommended for everyone over 6 months old, especially those in high-risk categories. In a typical year, flu season occurs from fall to early spring — and with it comes sniffling, sneezing, coughing, fatigue, and all the familiar trappings of the flu. The severity of the illness varies by person. Flu shots are vital in helping to protect the population, and especially vulnerable groups, from getting the flu."
443,Flu,What is the flu?,"Influenza (the flu) is a common, infectious virus spread by droplets that enter another person’s body. From there, the virus takes hold and begins to develop. Each year, the flu spreads across the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates that around40 millionpeople had the flu during the 2023–2024 flu season. Many strains of the flu exist. Doctors and researchers determine which strains of the virus will be most common each year. Those strains are then used to produce vaccines. A flu vaccine is one of the easiest and most effective ways to prevent the flu. In the United States, the main flu season stretches from October to March. Cases of the flu peak between December and February, according to theCDC. But you can get the flu at any time of the year. You’re more likely to get sick during the fall and winter months. This is because you’re spending more time in close quarters with other people and are also exposed to lots of different illnesses."
444,Flu,What are the symptoms of the flu?,"Here are some of the common symptoms of the flu: Fever:Most flu-relatedfeversrange from a low grade fever of around100°F (37.8°C)to as high as 104°F (40°C) in adults. Although alarming, it’s not uncommon for young children to have higher fevers than adults. If you suspect your child has the flu, it’s important to speak with a doctor. Cough:Adry, persistent coughis common with the flu. It may worsen, becoming uncomfortable and painful. Muscle aches:Flu-relatedmuscle painsare most common in your neck, back, arms, and legs. They can often be severe, making it difficult to move even when trying to perform basic tasks. Headache:Your first symptom of the flu may be a severeheadache, which may also cause light and sound sensitivity. Fatigue:Feeling tired is a not-so-obvious symptom of the flu. Feeling generally unwell can be a sign of many conditions. These feelings of tiredness and fatigue may come on fast and be difficult to overcome. Childrenand adults share many of the same symptoms. Some people may experience more symptoms that others. Each person will be different. Learn about early flu symptoms."
445,Flu,"What causes the flu, and is it contagious?","The flu is a virus that’s spread inseveral ways. First, you can contract the virus from a person near you who has the flu and sneezes, coughs, or talks. If someone with the virus touched a common surface, like a door handle or a keyboard, and you touch the same surface, you could get the virus. Once you have the virus on your hand, it can enter your body if you touch your mouth, eyes, or nose. If you have the flu, you’recontagious— meaning you can pass the flu to others. Many people can spread the virus as early as a day before they show symptoms. In other words, you may be transmitting the virus before you even realize that you’re sick. You may still be spreading the virus5 to 7days after your symptoms appear. If you have the flu or any flu symptoms, stay home. Do your part to prevent the spread of the virus to other people."
446,Flu,Flu vs. cold and flu vs. COVID-19,"The symptoms ofCOVID-19, the flu, and a cold have some overlap but are often different. As a rule, flu and COVID-19 symptoms are more severe than cold symptoms. Your symptoms can help you tell the difference between them."
447,Flu,How long does the flu last?,Most people recover from the flu in afew days to 2 weeks. But it may take several more days for you to feel back to your usual self. It’s important to stay home from school or work until your symptoms are improving and you’ve been free of fever forat least 24 hours(and that’s without taking fever-reducing medications).
448,Flu,Treatment options for the flu,"Most cases of the flu are mild enough that you can treat yourself at home without prescription medications. It’s important you stay home and avoid contact with other people when you first notice flu symptoms. You should also: Drink plenty of fluids. This includes water, soup, and low-sugar flavored drinks. Treat symptoms such as headache and fever with OTC medications. Wash your hands to prevent spreading the virus to other surfaces or to other people in your house. Cover your coughs and sneezes with tissues. Immediately dispose of those tissues. Wear a face covering when in public. OTC medications can help relieve symptoms of the flu, but they won’t treat it. If you have the flu and are looking for symptom relief, consider these medications: Decongestants.Nasal decongestantshelp break up mucus in your sinuses, which helps to clear your nose. Decongestants come in several forms, including nasal decongestants that are inhaled and oral (pill) decongestants. Cough suppressants.Coughing, especiallyat night, is a common flu symptom. OTC cough medications can ease or suppress your cough reflex. Cough drops, or lozenges can soothe a sore throat and suppress coughing. Expectorants.This type of medication may help you cough up phlegm if you have a lot of mucus or congestion in your chest. OTC treatments like NyQuil often contain several of these types of drugs in one pill. If you take one of these combination medications, avoid taking other medications with it. This ensures that you don’t take too much of any one type of drug. Medications called antiviral drugscan treatthe flu. They’re available by prescription only from a healthcare professional and are typically given to those with severe symptoms or those at risk of being hospitalized from the flu. Antiviral medications can help ease flu symptoms. They can also shorten the length of the flu by a day or two. Taking antiviral medications may help if you get the flu, but these medications also have side effects. Talk with a doctor to understand the risks. If left untreated, a typical case of the flu often goes away in about 1 week. During that time, somenatural flu remediesmay be helpfulfor easing symptoms alongside medication. For instance, for a sore throat or cough, some options include: honey warm tea warm soup It is important to remember that honey should not be given to childrenunder 12 monthsdue to the risk ofbotulism. Of course, rest is also an important part of recovering from the flu, or any other type of virus. Your body is fighting hard to get well. It’s wise for you to stop, rest, and get more sleep so your immune system can fight back against the virus."
449,Flu,What to know about flu shots,"The best and most efficient way to avoid the flu and prevent spreading it is to get a flu vaccination. Theflu vaccineis available in the following forms: injectable shot high-dose injectable shot (for those over age 65) intradermal shot nasal spray The more people that get vaccinated against the flu, the less the flu can spread. It also helps withherd immunity, helping to protect those who can’t get the vaccine for medical reasons. Vaccination can also helplessen the severityof the illness if you do end up getting the flu. To make the vaccine, scientists select the strains of the flu virus that research suggests will be the most common in the coming flu season. Millions of vaccines with those strains are produced and distributed. Once you receive the vaccine, your body begins producing antibodies against those strains of the virus. These antibodies provide protection against the virus. If you come into contact with the flu virus at a later point, you can avoid contracting it. You may get sick if you end up coming into contact with a different strain of the virus. But the symptoms will be less severe because you had the vaccination. Doctors recommend that everyone over the age of6 monthsreceive the flu vaccine. This is especially true for people inhigh risk categorieslike: pregnant people children under age 5 people ages 18 and under who receive aspirin therapy people over age 65 people whose body mass index is 40 or higher anyone working or living in a nursing home or chronic care facility caregivers to any of the above anyone with chronic medical conditions Most doctors also recommend that everyone gets their flu vaccine by the end of October. This way your body has time to develop the right antibodies before flu season kicks into gear. Even if you don’t get the flu shot by October 31, it’s not too late. Even if it’s well into flu season, it’s always helpful to get the flu shot. Learn more about the importance of the flu shot. Many people report avoiding the flu vaccine each year for fear that it will make them sick. It’s important to understand that the flu vaccinecan’t causeyou to develop the flu. Like other shots, you may experience some side effects from the flu shot. These side effects are often mild and only last a short period of time. The most commonside effectsof the flu shot include: soreness around the injection site low-grade fever in the days immediately following the injection mild aches and stiffness Any side effects that do occur often last only a day or two. Many people won’t experience any side effects at all. Each year,millionsof children get sick from the flu. Some of these illnesses are severe and require hospitalization. Children who get the flu are often at a higher risk than adults who get sick from the flu. You should see a doctor right away if your child has been exposed to the flu or shows flu symptoms. Vaccinating children each year is thebest wayto protect them against the flu. If your child only received one dose in the flu season prior, they may need two doses this flu season. Ask your child’s doctor how many doses your child needs, as they may need two doses if they are under eight years old. Children under 6 months of age are too young for a flu vaccine. To protect them, make sure the people around them get vaccinated. This includes family members and care givers. Most doctors’ offices carry the vaccine. You may also get the vaccine at: pharmacies walk-in medical clinics county or city health departments Some employers and schools also offer flu shot clinics on site. If you can’t find a flu shot provider, use a flu shot locator likevaccines.gov. This website lists businesses, phone numbers, and hours of operation."
450,Flu,When to speak with a doctor,"If symptoms become worse, you should speak with a doctor. They may prescribe an antiviral medication. The sooner you take this medication, the more effective it is. If you’re at high risk for flu-related complications, speak with a doctor as soon as symptoms appear. They may test for the flu virus right away. They may also prescribe an antiviral medication to prevent complications."
451,Flu,The bottom line,"Influenza (the flu) is a common, infectious virus spread by droplets that enter another person’s body. From there, the virus takes hold and begins to develop. Symptoms typically include sneezing, muscle aches, and a fever. Most cases of the flu are mild enough to treat yourself at home with plenty of rest and OTC medications. Prescription medications are available and are typically given to those with severe symptoms or those at risk of being hospitalized from the flu. Getting a flu vaccination is the best and most efficient way to avoid the flu and prevent its spread. It can also help reduce the severity of the illness if you end up getting the flu."
452,Food Poisoning,Overview,"Food poisoning usually isn’t life threatening. It can be uncomfortable, but most people recover completely within a few days, even without treatment."
453,Food Poisoning,What is food poisoning?,"Foodborne illness, typically known as food poisoning, results from eating contaminated, spoiled, or toxic food. The most common symptoms of food poisoning are nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. Although it’s quite uncomfortable, food poisoning isn’t unusual. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 48 million people (around 1 in 7 people) in the United States contract some form of food poisoning every year. Of those 48 million people, 128,000 are admitted to hospitals."
454,Food Poisoning,Food poisoning symptoms,"If you have food poisoning, chances are it won’t go undetected. Thesymptomscan vary depending on the source of the infection. A case of food poisoning will typically involve a few of the following symptoms: abdominal cramps diarrhea nausea vomiting loss of appetite mild fever weakness headache Symptoms of potentially life threatening food poisoning include: diarrhea that lasts for more than 3 days a fever higher than102°F (38.9°C) difficulty seeing or speaking symptoms ofsevere dehydration, such as:dry mouthlittle to no urine outputdifficulty keeping fluids down dry mouth little to no urine output difficulty keeping fluids down bloody urine If you experience any of these symptoms, contact a doctor or seek medical treatment immediately. The length of time it takes for symptoms to appear depends on the source of the infection, but it can range from30 minutesto8 weeks. With or without treatment, most cases will resolve within1 week."
455,Food Poisoning,Causes of food poisoning,"Most food poisoning can be traced to one of three major causes: bacteria parasites viruses Thesepathogenscan be found on almost all food humans eat. However, heat from cooking usually kills the pathogens before the food reaches your plate. Foods eaten raw are common sources of food poisoning because they don’t go through the cooking process. Occasionally, food comes into contact with organisms from fecal matter or vomit. This is most likely to happen when someone who is ill prepares food withoutwashing their handsfirst. Some frequently contaminated foods are: meat eggs dairy water Bacteria are by far the most common cause of food poisoning. Bacterial causes of food poisoning include: E. coli— in particular, Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) Listeria monocytogenes Salmonella Campylobacter Clostridium botulinum Staphylococcus aureus Shigella Vibrio vulnificus When you think of dangerous bacteria, names such as “E. coli” and “Salmonella” likely come to mind — and for a good reason. Salmonella isthe biggest bacterial causeof food poisoning cases in the United States. According to theCDC, an estimated 1.35 million cases of food poisoning, including 26,500 hospitalizations, can be traced to Salmonella infection each year. Food poisoning caused byparasitesisn’t as common as food poisoning caused by bacteria, but parasites that spread through food are still very dangerous. They include: Toxoplasma gondii Giardia lamblia various tapeworms, such as:Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm)Taenia solium (pork tapeworm)Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm) Taenia saginata (beef tapeworm) Taenia solium (pork tapeworm) Diphyllobothrium latum (fish tapeworm) Cryptosporidium Ascaris lumbricoides, a type of roundworm flukes (flatworms), such as Opisthorchiidae (liver fluke) and Paragonimus (lung fluke) pinworms, or Enterobiasis Trichinella According to theCDC, toxoplasmosis is a leading cause of death attributed to food poisoning in the United States. Toxoplasma gondii is also found in cat litter boxes. Parasites can live in your digestive tract and may go undetected for years.Pregnant peopleand those withweakened immune systemsare at risk of more serious side effects if certain parasites take up residence in their intestines. Food poisoning can also be caused by a virus, such as: norovirus, which is sometimes known as the Norwalk virus rotavirus astrovirus sapovirus hepatitis A virus The norovirus causes19 million to 21 million casesof vomiting and diarrhea in the United States each year. In rare cases, it can be fatal. Other viruses cause similar symptoms but are less common."
456,Food Poisoning,Common sources,
457,Food Poisoning,Food poisoning treatments,"Food poisoning can usually be treated at home. Here are some ways you can help treat food poisoning: If you have food poisoning, it’s crucial to stay properly hydrated. Sports drinks that arehigh in electrolytescan be helpful. Fruit juice and coconut water can restore carbohydrates and help withfatigue. Try to avoidcaffeine, which may irritate your digestive tract. Decaffeinated teas made with soothing herbs may help calm an upset stomach. Examples include: chamomile peppermint dandelion Read about moreremedies for an upset stomach. OTC medications such as loperamide (Imodium) andPepto-Bismolcan help you manage diarrhea and suppress nausea. Pyrantel pamoate (Reese’s Pinworm Medicine) is a commonremedyfor pinworms. However, you should check with a doctor before using these medications because your body uses vomiting and diarrhea to get rid of the toxin. Also, using these medications could mask the severity of your condition and cause you to delay seeking expert treatment. Although many cases of food poisoning clear up on their own, you may benefit from prescription medications, depending on the pathogen responsible for your condition. Prescription medications may be helpful if you are older, immunocompromised, or pregnant.Antibiotictreatmentcan help prevent an infection from transmitting to your unborn baby. If you need prescription medications, a doctor may recommend the following medications for certain causes of foodborne illness: A. lumbricoides:the antiparasitic medications albendazole (Albenza) or mebendazole (Enverm) Campylobacter:the antibioticazithromycin(Zithromax) Cryptosporidium:the antiparasitic medication nitazoxanide (Alinia), which is used to treat diarrhea D. latum (fish tapeworm):the antiparasitic medication praziquantel (Biltricide) Enterobiasis (pinworms):albendazole (Albenza) or mebendazole (Enverm) G. lamblia:nitazoxanide (Alinia)the antibioticsmetronidazole(Flagyl), paromomycin, quinacrine, or furazolidonethe antibiotic and antiparasitic medication tinidazole (Tindamax) nitazoxanide (Alinia) the antibioticsmetronidazole(Flagyl), paromomycin, quinacrine, or furazolidone the antibiotic and antiparasitic medication tinidazole (Tindamax) L. monocytogenes:the antibioticampicillin Opisthorchiidae (liver fluke):praziquantel (Biltricide) or albendazole (Albenza) Paragonimus (lung fluke):praziquantel (Biltricide) or the antiparasitic medication triclabendazole (Egaten) Shigella:the antibiotics azithromycin (Zithromax) or ciprofloxacin (Cipro) T. saginata(beef tapeworm):praziquantel (Biltricide) or albendazole (Albenza), which areoff-label treatments T. solium(pork tapeworm):praziquantel (Biltricide) or albendazole (Albenza), which are off-label treatments T. gondii:a combination of the antiparasitic medication pyrimethamine (Daraprim) and an antibiotic such as sulfadiazinethe antibiotic spiramycin, as a stand-alone medication a combination of the antiparasitic medication pyrimethamine (Daraprim) and an antibiotic such as sulfadiazine the antibiotic spiramycin, as a stand-alone medication Trichinella:albendazole (Albenza) or mebendazole (Enverm) Off-label drug use means a drug that’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for one purpose is used for a different purpose that hasn’t yet been approved. However, a doctor can still use the drug for that purpose. This is because the FDA regulates the testing and approval of drugs but not how doctors use drugs to treat their patients. So a doctor can prescribe a drug however they think is best for your care. An infection with C. botulinum is considered a medical emergency. Seek medical care as soon as you can. If you have a case of C. botulinum, a doctor will administer an antitoxin. Babies will receive a special antitoxin called BabyBIG (botulism immune globulin). It’s important to get plenty of rest when you’re recovering from food poisoning. In severe cases of food poisoning, you may need hydration withintravenous (IV) fluidsat a hospital. In the very worst cases of food poisoning, a longer hospital stay may be required while you recover. Severe cases of C. botulinum, which are rare, may even requiremechanical ventilation."
458,Food Poisoning,What you should try to eat,"It’s best to avoid solid foods until diarrhea and vomiting have passed. Instead, ease back into your regular diet by eating or drinkingeasy-to-digest foodsthat areblandand low in fat, such as: saltine crackers toast gelatin bananas rice oatmeal bland potatoes boiled vegetables chicken broth soda without caffeine, such as ginger ale or root beer diluted fruit juices sports drinks"
459,Food Poisoning,What food you should try to avoid,"To prevent your stomach from getting more upset, try to avoid the following harder-to-digest foods, even if you think you feel better: dairy products, especially milk and cheese fatty foods fried foods highly seasoned foods foods that are high in sugar spicy foods Also avoid: caffeine alcohol nicotine"
460,Food Poisoning,How food poisoning is diagnosed,"A doctor may be able to determine which type of food poisoning you have based on your symptoms. In severe cases, healthcare professionals may performblood tests,stool tests, and tests on food that you’ve eaten to find out what’s responsible for your food poisoning. A doctor may also use aurine testto evaluate whether you are dehydrated due to food poisoning. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, check outour FindCare tool here."
461,Food Poisoning,Risk factors for food poisoning,"Anyone can contract food poisoning. Statistically speaking, nearly everyone will experience food poisoning at least once in their lives. Some populations are more at risk than others, including: Immunocompromised people:Anyone with a suppressed immune system or anautoimmune diseasemay have a greater risk of infection and complications resulting from food poisoning. Pregnant people:Pregnant people are more at risk because their bodies are coping with changes to their metabolism and circulatory system during pregnancy. Older adults:Adults 65 years old or older are at a greater risk of contracting food poisoning because their immune systems may not respond quickly to infectious organisms. Young children:Children under 5 years old are also considered an at-risk population because their immune systems aren’t as developed as those of adults. Young children are more easily affected bydehydrationfrom vomiting and diarrhea."
462,Food Poisoning,How to prevent food poisoning,"The best way to prevent food poisoning is to handle your food safely and avoid any food that may be unsafe. Some foods aremore likelyto cause food poisoning because of how they’re produced and prepared. Infectious agents that are killed during cooking may be present in certain foods, such as: meat poultry eggs shellfish Food poisoning can occur if these foods are eaten in their raw form if they are not cooked properly, or if people don’t properly clean their hands and other surfaces that have had contact with the food. Other foods that are likely to cause food poisoning include: sushiandother fish productsthat are served raw or undercooked deli meats and hot dogs that aren’t heated or cooked ground beef, which may contain meat from several animals unpasteurized milk, cheese, and juice raw, unwashed fruits and vegetables To try to avoid food poisoning, take these steps: Alwayswash your handsbefore cooking or eating food. Make sure your food is properly sealed andstored. Thoroughly cookmeatand eggs. Sanitize any surface or utensil that comes into contact with raw foods before using it to prepare other foods. Make sure towash fruits and vegetablesbefore serving them."
463,Food Poisoning,Outlook for food poisoning,"It’s extremely rare for food poisoning to be life threatening. While having food poisoning is quite uncomfortable, the good news is that most people recover completely within a few days, even without treatment."
464,Food Poisoning,Frequently asked questions,"Food poisoning typically starts to cause symptoms, such as diarrhea or vomiting, within 3 to 6 hours after you’ve eaten something. The stomach flu takes longer to cause symptoms — typically 12 to 24 hours."
465,Food Poisoning,The takeaway,"Millions of people get food poisoning every year. Many cases of bacterial, viral, or parasitic food poisoning are treatable, and food poisoning very rarely requires serious medical attention. You can take certain steps to prevent food poisoning, such as washing your hands before preparing meals and avoiding raw or undercooked meat, poultry, eggs, and shellfish.

466,Fracture,Overview,"What is a fracture? A fracture is a broken bone. It can range from a thin crack to a complete break. Bone can fracture crosswise, lengthwise, in several places, or into many pieces. Most fractures happen when a bone is impacted by more force or pressure than it can support. If you suspect you have a fracture, seek medical help immediately."
467,Fracture,What are the symptoms of a fracture?,"Most fractures are accompanied by intense pain when the initial injury occurs. It may become worse when you move or touch the injured area. In some cases, you may even pass out from the pain. You may also feel dizzy or chilled from shock. Other potential symptoms of a fracture include: a snap or grinding sound when the injury occurs swelling, redness, and bruising in the injured area difficulty supporting weight with the injured area visible deformity in the injured area In some cases, you may see broken bone poking through your skin."
468,Fracture,What are the different types of fracture?,"Fractures can be classified as closed or open, as well as incomplete or complete. A closed fracture is also called a simple fracture. In a closed fracture, the broken bone doesn’t break your skin. An open fracture is also called a compound fracture. In an open fracture, the ends of the broken bone tear your skin. When your bone and other internal tissues are exposed, it puts you at higher risk of infection. In an incomplete fracture, your bone doesn’t break completely. In other words, it cracks without breaking all the way through. Types of incomplete fracture include: hairline fracture, in which your bone is broken in a thin crack greenstick fracture, in which your bone is broken on one side, while the other side is bent buckle or torus fracture, in which your bone is broken on one side and a bump or raised buckle develops on the other side In a complete fracture, your bone breaks completely. It’s snapped or crushed into two or more pieces. Types of complete fracture include: single fracture, in which your bone is broken in one place into two pieces comminuted fracture, in which your bone is broken or crushed into three or more pieces compression fracture, in which your bone collapses under pressure nondisplaced fracture, in which your bone breaks into pieces that stay in their normal alignment displaced fracture, in which your bone breaks into pieces that move out of their normal alignment segmental fracture, in which your bone is broken in two places in a way that leaves at least one segment floating and unattached Incomplete fractures are more common in children. Their bones are softer than those of adults. As a result, they’re more likely to bend than break. Complete fractures can happen at any age."
469,Fracture,What causes a fracture?,"You can develop a fracture when your bone is impacted with greater pressure or force than it can support. This force usually occurs suddenly or is very intense. The strength of the force determines the severity of the fracture. Some common causes of fractures include: falls direct strikes to your body traumatic events, such as car accidents or gunshot wounds injuries from sports"
470,Fracture,Who is at risk of a fracture?,"Anyone can be experience a fracture. But you’re more likely to develop one if you have brittle bones, or low bone density. You’re more likely to develop brittle bones if you: are older have osteoporosis have endocrine or intestinal disorders are taking corticosteroids are physically inactive drink alcohol smoke"
471,Fracture,How is a fracture diagnosed?,"If you suspect you have a fracture, get medical attention immediately. Your doctor will likely ask you about your symptoms and perform a visual examination of the injured area. They may ask you to move the area in certain ways to check for pain or other signs of injury. If they think you may have a fracture, your doctor will likely order X-rays. According to theAmerican Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, X-rays are the most common method of fracture diagnosis. They can create images of your bone and reveal breaks or other signs of damage. X-rays also help determine fracture type and location. In some instances, your doctor may also order magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computed tomography scans (CT or CAT scan) to examine your bones or surrounding tissues."
472,Fracture,How is a fracture treated?,"If you’re diagnosed with a fracture, the treatment plan will depend on its type and location. In general, your doctor will try to put the broken bone pieces back into their proper positions and stabilize them as they heal. It’s important to keep pieces of broken bone immobile until they’re mended. During the healing process, new bone will form around the edges of the broken pieces. If they’re properly aligned and stabilized, the new bone will eventually connect the pieces. Your doctor may use a cast to stabilize your broken bone. Your cast will likely be made from plaster or fiberglass. It will help keep the injured area stabilized and prevent broken bone pieces from moving while they heal. In rare cases, you may need traction to stabilize the injured area. Traction stretches the muscles and tendons around your bone. Your doctor will administer it using a system of pulleys and weights positioned in a metal frame over your bed. This system will produce a gentle pulling motion that your doctor can use to stabilize the injured area. For more complex or compound fractures, you may need surgery. Your doctor may use open reduction, and internal fixation or external fixation to keep your bones from moving. In open reduction and internal fixation, your doctor will first reposition or “reduce” the pieces of broken bone into their normal alignment. Then they will connect or “fix” the broken bone. This occurs by using screws, metal plates, or both. In some cases, your doctor may insert rods through the center of your bone. In external fixation, your doctor will put pins or screws into your bone above and below the fracture site. They will connect these pins or screws to a metal stabilizing bar positioned on the outside of your skin. The bar will hold your bone in place as it heals. Your doctor may also prescribe medication to control pain, fight infection, or manage other symptoms or complications. After the initial treatment stages, they may recommend physical therapy or other strategies to help you regain normal use."
473,Fracture,What is the outlook for a fracture?,"If you experience a fracture, its location and severity will help determine how long it takes to heal. Your age and medical history can also affect your recovery process. Certain medical conditions may impair your body’s ability to mend broken bones. It may take several weeks, or sometimes months, for your fracture to heal. In most cases, the pain will subside before the healing process is complete. You will likely need to restrict movement of the injured area while it mends. You may not be able to participate in some of your normal activities. You may also have to make adjustments to your routine, until you are healed. Once your fracture is healed, you may be able to return to your normal activities and routine. In some cases, you may need physical therapy. This will help you to regain your normal use of the injured area. Immobilizing part of your body for a long period of time can cause you to lose muscle strength and range of motion. Physical therapy can help you recover more fully. To promote your recovery, follow your doctor’s medical instructions closely."
474,Fracture,How can fractures be prevented?,"You can’t prevent all fractures. But you can work to keep your bones strong so they’ll be less susceptible to damage. To maintain your bone strength, consume a nutritious diet, including foods that are rich in calcium and vitamin D. It’s also important to exercise regularly. Weight-bearing exercises are particularly helpful for building and maintaining bone strength. Examples include walking, hiking, running, dancing, and weight training."
475,Fungal Infection,Overview,"Fungi are microorganisms with a substance in their cell walls called chitin. Some, like mushrooms, are edible, while others, like Aspergillus, can be dangerous. Infections include athlete’s foot and thrush. Different types of fungi can cause fungal infections. In some cases, fungi that aren’t typically found on or inside your body can colonize it and cause an infection. In other cases, fungi that are normally present on or inside your body can multiply out of control and cause an infection. Fungal infections can be contagious. They can spread from one person to another. In some cases, you can also catch disease-causing fungi from infected animals or contaminated soil or surfaces. If you develop signs or symptoms of a fungal infection, make an appointment with your doctor."
476,Fungal Infection,Common types,"A fungal infection is also known as mycosis. Although most fungi are harmless to humans, some of them are capable of causing diseases under specific conditions. Fungi reproduce by releasing spores that can be picked up by direct contact or even inhaled. That’s why fungal infections are most likely to affect your skin, nails, or lungs. Fungi can also penetrate your skin, affect your organs, and cause a body-wide systemic infection. Some common types of fungal infection include: athlete’s foot jock itch ringworm yeast infection onychomycosis, or a fungal infection of the nail Some types of fungi don’t normally cause infections in humans but can cause sickness in people with weakened immune systems. These are called opportunistic infections."
477,Fungal Infection,Pictures of fungal infection,
478,Fungal Infection,Athlete’s foot,"Athlete’s foot is also known as tinea pedis. It’s a type of fungal infection that can affect the skin on your feet, as well as your hands and nails. The infection is caused by dermatophytes, a group of fungi that can thrive in the warm and humid areas between your toes. It’s particularly common among athletes and can spread from one person to another. You can also catch it from contaminated surfaces, like a public shower or locker room floors. Athlete’s foot can cause an itching, stinging, or burning sensation between your toes or on other parts of your foot. Your skin might also crack, peel, or blister. Your doctor may recognize athlete’s foot by looking at the symptoms on your skin. If the doctor isn’t sure, a small area of the skin can be scraped off and tested for the fungus. There are several topical over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal medications you can use to treat athlete’s foot. If those don’t provide relief, your doctor can prescribe something stronger.Get the information you need to stop athlete’s foot in its tracks. Shop for antifungal products on Amazon."
479,Fungal Infection,Jock itch,"Jock itch is also known as tinea cruris. It’s a fungal infection that can affect the skin on your groin area, as well as your inner thighs and buttocks. Like athlete’s foot, it’s caused by dermatophytes, a group of fungi that thrive in warm and humid areas. This type of infection mostly affects men and boys, but women and girls can develop it too. Common jock itch symptoms include: redness itchiness a burning feeling changes in skin color flaking or cracking skin a rash that gets worse when you exercise Often, a doctor will be able to recognize jock itch by looking at the affected skin. To help rule out other conditions, like psoriasis, they may take a scraping of skin cells and have them examined. Jock itch can usually be treated at home by keeping the area clean and dry and applying OTC antifungal cream, powder, or spray. If your symptoms don’t improve after two weeks of home care, see your doctor. They can prescribe stronger antifungal medications.Learn how to recognize, treat, and prevent jock itch."
480,Fungal Infection,Ringworm,"Ringworm is a fungal infection that can affect your skin and scalp. Similar to athlete’s foot and jock itch, it’s caused by dermatophytes. Ringworm is also part of a group of fungi that grow on skin, particularly in damp and humid parts of your body. It usually starts as a reddish, itchy, scaly rash. Over time, patches of ringworm can spread and form red rings. Other signs include: patches that get blisters and start to ooze bald patches on the scalp patches that look like rings with a redder outside edge thick, discolored, or cracked nails (if the infection is in the nails) A simple skin examination can find ringworm. The fungus glows under a black light, so your doctor can tell if you have it by shining the black light over the affected area. A small sample of the affected skin can also be scraped off and sent to a lab for testing. Like jock itch and athlete’s foot, ringworm is often able to be successfully treated with OTC antifungal creams, sprays, gels, or ointments. You may need a prescription if your case is more severe or the infection is located on the nails or scalp.Gain a better understanding of ringworm, including ways to prevent and treat it."
481,Fungal Infection,Yeast infection,"Candida albicans is a type of fungus that can infect your skin, mouth, gastrointestinal tract, urinary tract, or genitals. It’s normal for small amounts of candida albicans to be present on your skin and in your body. But when these fungi multiply too much, they can cause an infection known as a yeast infection. If you get a yeast infection in your throat or mouth, it’s called oral thrush. Thrush causes white patches to form in your mouth and throat. People who undergo prolonged antibiotic therapy often develop this type of infection. In women,vaginal yeast infectionsare relatively common. They can cause: pain itchiness clumpy discharge swelling redness To check for oral thrush, your doctor can use a throat swab to rub the affected areas. Throat swabs look like a cotton bud. Your doctor can send the swab to a lab, where technicians will culture it to learn what types of fungi or other microbes are present. Your doctor will perform a pelvic exam to diagnose a vaginal yeast infection. If they aren’t sure your symptoms are being caused by a yeast infection, they might swab the area and order a lab test. Your treatment options will depend on the type of yeast infection you have and whether or not you get yeast infections regularly. Thrush can be treated with oral antifungal medications. These can come in the form of lozenges, pills, or mouthwash.Find out more about oral thrush. If you catch a vaginal yeast infection early enough, you might be able to treat it with OTC products. Otherwise, your doctor can prescribe antifungal medications that come as a cream, pill, or vaginal suppository. Your doctor might also recommend probiotics, such asLactobacillus acidophilus. Probiotic supplements provide good bacteria that might help restore your body’s microbial balance.Learn more about the symptoms of a vaginal yeast infection and why early treatment is so important."
482,Fungal Infection,Toenail fungus,"Onychomycosis is a common type of fungal infection that can affect your toenails, fingernails, and nail beds. It’s also known as tinea unguium. Toenail fungus usually starts as a small light-colored spot on your nail. As it spreads deeper, it changes the shape and color of your nail. Over time, it can cause your nail to become thicker and more brittle. Common signs include: scaling under the nail white or yellow streaks under the nail flakiness or crumbling of the nail thick or brittle nail lifting off the nail bed To find out if you have toenail fungus, your doctor will likely scrape off pieces of the affected nail. They will examine these scrapings under a microscope. This can help them tell the difference between a fungal infection and other conditions that cause similar symptoms. It can potentially take weeks to treat fingernail infections and months to treat toenail infections. OTC medications typically aren’t effective. Your doctor may prescribe a nail lacquer that’s brushed on like nail polish or an antibiotic you take by mouth. Since this type of infection can be so hard to treat, it’s important to avoid spreading it.Learn how to protect yourself from fungal infections of your nails and nail beds."
483,Fungal Infection,Who is at risk?,"There several things that can increase your risk of developing a fungal infection. These include environmental factors as well as what’s going on in your body when you’re exposed to a fungus. Sweating heavily or working in a warm, humid environment can increase your risk of a fungal infection. Fungi need a warm and moist environment to grow. Walking barefoot in damp places, such as gyms, locker rooms, and showers, can also increase your risk. These public places are often rich in fungal spores. Any condition that causes poor blood circulation can raise your risk of infection. Poor circulation hinders your immune response and decreases your body’s ability to fight off an infection.Explore this list of causes of poor circulation. If you’re a postmenopausal women, hormonal changes can reduce the acidity of your vagina. This might make you more vulnerable to vaginal yeast infections.Learn how to recognize the symptoms of menopause. If your immune system isn’t working properly, it can leave you vulnerable to fungal infections. Many things can potentially weaken your immune system. For example, nutrient deficiencies, immunodeficiency disorders, smoking, and even stress can impair your immune function.Learn more about immunodeficiency disorders. Even a small nail or skin injury or infection can allow fungi to get under your skin and affect deeper tissues. That’s why it’s important to wash wounds and cover them in a sterile dressing or bandage.Learn how to treat minor wounds and prevent infections. Some types of medications can reduce your body’s ability to ward off fungal infections. For example, antibiotics destroy helpful bacteria along with harmful bacteria. This can allow fungi to thrive, free of competition. Long-term use of corticosteroids can also increase your risk of fungal infection. Cancer treatments, including chemotherapy and radiation, may put you at higher risk too. If your immune system has been weakened, ask your doctor what steps you can take to limit your risk of fungal infections."
484,Fungal Infection,How can fungal infections be prevented?,"Good hygiene is also critical for avoiding fungal infections. Try to: keep your skin clean and dry, particularly the folds of your skin wash your hands often, especially after touching animals or other people avoid using other people’s towels and other personal care products wear shoes in locker rooms, community showers, and swimming pools wipe gym equipment before and after using it"
485,Fungal Infection,Takeaway,"Fungal infections can be uncomfortable or even painful. In some cases, they can take weeks or months to effectively treat. If you think you have a fungal infection, see your doctor. They can diagnose the type of infection and recommend an appropriate antifungal medication. In some cases, your doctor may also recommend changes to your diet or other daily habits to help treat or prevent future fungal infections.

486,Fungal Nail Infection,Overview,"Fungal nail infections are common and are caused by fungi that live in the environment. They enter through small cracks in your nail or the nearby skin, causing infection. Fungal infectionscan affect any part of the body. Fungi are normally present in and on the body alongside various bacteria. But when a fungus begins to overgrow, you can get an infection. Onychomycosis, also called tinea unguium, is a fungal infection that affects either thefingernails or toenails. Fungal infections normally develop over time, so any immediate difference in the way your nail looks or feels may be too subtle to notice at first."
487,Fungal Nail Infection,Why does it develop?,"A fungal nail infection occurs from the overgrowth of fungi in, under, or on the nail. Fungi thrive in warm, moist environments, so this type of environment can cause them to naturally overpopulate. The same fungi that causejock itch,athlete’s foot, andringwormcan cause nail infections. Fungi that are already present in or on your body can cause nail infections. If you have come in contact with someone else who has a fungal infection, you may have contracted it as well. Fungal infections affect toenails more commonly than fingernails, likely because your toes are usually confined to shoes, where they’re in a warm, moist environment. If you get a manicure or pedicure at a nail salon, be sure to ask how the staff disinfects their tools and how often they do it. Tools, such as emery boards and nail clippers, can spread fungal infections from person to person if they’re not sanitized."
488,Fungal Nail Infection,Who’s at risk for fungal infections?,"There are many different causes of fungal nail infections. Each cause has a treatment of its own. Although many of the causes of a fungal nail infection are preventable, some risk factors increase the likelihood of developing one. You’re more likely to develop a fungal nail infection if you: havediabetes have a disease that causespoor circulation are over age 65 wear artificial nails swim in a public swimming pool have a nail injury have a skin injury around the nail have moist fingers or toes for an extended time have aweakened immune system wear closed-toe shoes, such as tennis shoes or boots Nail infections occurmore oftenin men than in women, and the infections are found in adults more often than in children. If you have family members who often get these types of fungal infections, you’re more likely to get them as well. Older adults have a high risk for getting fungal nail infections because they have poorer circulation. The nails also grow more slowly and thicken as we age."
489,Fungal Nail Infection,What does it look like?,"A fungal infection of the nail may affect part of the nail, the entire nail, or several nails. Common signs of a fungal nail infection include: a distorted nail that may lift off from the nail bed an odor coming from the infected nail a brittle or thickened nail"
490,Fungal Nail Infection,What are common kinds of nail fungus?,"Distal subungual infections are the most common type of fungal nail infection and can develop in both fingernails and toenails. When infected, the outer edge of the nail has a jagged appearance with white and/or yellow streaks across the nail. The infection invades the nail bed and underside of the nail. White superficial infections usually affect toenails. A certain type of fungus attacks the top layers of the nail and creates well-defined white spots on the nail. Eventually these white patches cover the entire nail, which becomes rough, soft, and prone to crumbling. Spots on nail may become pitted and flaky. Proximal subungual infections are uncommon but can affect both fingernails and toenails. Yellow spots appear at the base of the nail as the infection spreads upward. This infection can commonly occur in people with compromised immune systems. It can also result from minor injury to the nail. Candidayeasts cause this type of infection. It can invade nails previously damaged by a prior infection or injury. More commonly,Candidaaffects fingernails. It often occurs in people who frequently soak their hands in water. These infections usually start by the cuticle around the nail, which becomes swollen, red, and tender to the touch. The nail itself may partially lift off the nail bed, or fall off completely."
491,Fungal Nail Infection,How do I know if I have a fungal nail infection?,"Because other infections can affect the nail and mimic symptoms of a fungal nail infection, the only way to confirm a diagnosis is to see a doctor. They’ll take a scraping of the nail and look under a microscope for signs of fungus. In some cases, your doctor may send the sample to a lab for analysis and identification."
492,Fungal Nail Infection,How is a fungal nail infection treated?,"Over-the-counter products aren’t usually recommended to treat nail infections since they don’t provide reliable results. Instead, your doctor may prescribe an oral antifungal medication, such as: terbinafine (Lamisil) itraconazole (Sporanox) fluconazole(Diflucan) griseofulvin(Gris-PEG) Your doctor may prescribe other antifungal treatments, such as antifungal nail lacquer or topical solutions. These treatments are brushed onto the nail in the same way that you’d apply nail polish. Depending on the type of fungus causing the infection, as well as the extent of the infection, you may have to use these medications for several months. Topical solutions aren’t generally effective in curing toenail fungal infections. Treatmentisn’t guaranteedto completely rid your body of the fungal infection. Complications from fungal infection are also possible."
493,Fungal Nail Infection,Tips to prevent fungal nail infections,"Making a few simple lifestyle changes can help prevent a fungal infection of the nails. Taking good care of your nails by keeping them well trimmed and clean is a good way to prevent infections. Also avoid injuring the skin around your nails. If you’re going to have damp or wet hands for an extended amount of time, you may want to wear rubber gloves. Other ways to prevent fungal infections of the nails include: washing your hands after touching infected nails drying your feet well after showering, especially between your toes getting manicures or pedicures from trustworthy salons avoiding being barefoot in public places reducing your use of artificial nails and nail polish"
494,Fungal Nail Infection,FAQ,"Nails that are brittle, discolored, or unusually thick are likely to have a fungal infection. A fungal infection may cause nails to crumble and crack easily. They may turn white or yellow. The entire nail may loosen and lift off and the surrounding skin can swell and grow painful. While you may see results from over-the-counter treatments and some may vouch for home remedies, the fastest and most effective proven treatments for nail fungus are prescription strength oral antifungal medications. Left untreated, toenail fungus is unlikely to resolve by itself. The infection may stay in the same place on the nail, or it may spread and worsen. Some people, particularly those with diabetes or those who have a weakened immune system, may develop a bacterial infection as a result of nail fungus."
495,Fungal Nail Infection,Long-term outlook,"For some people, a fungal nail infection can be difficult to cure, and the first round of medication might not work. The nail infection can’t be considered cured until a new nail that’s free from infection has grown in. Although this indicates that the nail is no longer infected, it’s possible for the fungal infection to return. In severe cases, there may be permanent damage to your nail, and it may have to be removed. The main complications of a fungal nail infection are: a resurgence of the infection a permanent loss of the affected nail a discoloration of the infected nail the spread of infection to other areas of the body and possibly the bloodstream the development of a bacterial skin infection calledcellulitis It’s especially important to see your doctor if you have diabetes and a fungal nail infection. People with diabetes have a greater risk for developing potentially serious complications caused by these infections. Talk to your doctor if you have diabetes and think you’re developing a fungal nail infection."
496,Fungal Skin Infection,Overview,"Candidiasis, scalp ringworm, jock itch, and athlete’s foot are all types of fungal skin infections. In some cases, oral antifungal medications may be required."
497,Fungal Skin Infection,What is a fungal skin infection?,"Fungi live everywhere. They can be found in soil, in the air, or even inside the body. They can also be found on plants, surfaces, or the skin. These microscopic organisms typically don’t cause any problems for your skin unless they multiply faster than normal or penetrate the skin through a cut or lesion. Since fungi thrive in warm, moist environments, fungal skin infections can often develop in sweaty or damp areas that don’t get much airflow. Some examples include the feet, groin, and folds of the skin. These infections usually appear as a scaly rash or as discolored and often itchy skin. You often acquire a fungal skin infection through direct contact. This can include coming into contact with fungi in or on: another person an animal items such as clothing gyms gym mats, like those used in wrestling hot tubs saunasand steam rooms Some fungal skin infections are very common. Although the infection can be uncomfortable and possibly contagious, it’s typically not serious unless you’reimmunocompromised. Although there are millions of species of fungi, justa few hundred of themcan actually causeinfections in humans, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). What’s more, only a few of those species are dermatophytes, which can affect the skin, nails, and hair. Nondermatophyte fungi can affect the nails but are more likely to occur in other places, such as the lungs or brain."
498,Fungal Skin Infection,Types of fungal skin infections and their treatments,"Many common fungal infections can affect the skin. Yeast is a type of fungus. A yeast calledCandidais naturally present on the skin and inside the human body. When itovergrows, an infection can occur, including on the skin. The most common species ofCandidaisCandida albicans. Other names for a yeast infection of the skin include: aCandidaskin infection a candidal skin infection cutaneous candidiasis candidiasis of the skin The infection occurs in warm, moist, and poorly ventilated areas. Areas that are typically infected include the folds of the buttocks (as in certain types ofdiaper rash) andunder the breasts. The symptoms of a yeast infection of the skin can include: a red or discolored rash itching stinging burning acne-like bumps around the rash The mucous membranes are another common site of fungal infections. Some examples of yeast infections in the mucous membranes arevaginal yeast infectionsandoral thrush. A primary care doctor should be able to diagnose a yeast infection of the skin during aphysical examination. They may also swab the skin and use askin cultureto confirm that yeast is the organism causing your symptoms. If you see a dermatologist instead, they may perform a skin scraping of the rash and then view the sample under a microscope to determine if there’sCandidagrowth. An important step in treating any yeast infection is keeping the skin clean and dry. Some yeast infections will go away on their own.Prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) antifungal drugsare also available. These drugs can either kill fungi directly or prevent them from growing and thriving. Topical versions include: clotrimazole econazole ketoconazole nystatin oxiconazole To help reduce itching, you can also use acorticosteroid creamsuch as hydrocortisone. Powders may help you keep your skin dry. It’s important to apply them2 to 3hoursbefore or after applying any creams. If the infection doesn’t resolve or improve, a doctor may prescribe oral antifungal medications, such as: fluconazole (Diflucan) To helptreat diaper rash, consider using zinc oxide creams to soothe your baby’s skin. OTC options include products from the brands: A+D Balmex Desitin Triple Paste Home remedies such as changing diapers more frequently and using disposable diapers may also relieve symptoms. Check out our reviews ofthe best disposable diaperson the market. Ringwormis a common fungal skin infection. It’s highly contagious but not serious. Despite its name, ringworm is caused by a fungus and not a worm. It typically occurs on the torso and limbs, in a subtype known asringworm of the body (tinea corporis). Ringworm on other areas of the body can go by different names, such as jock itch and athlete’s foot. The main symptom of ringworm is a ring-shaped rash with slightly raised edges. The skin inside these circular rashes usually looks healthy. The rash can spread and is often itchy. Ringworm can come from petting an animal infected with the fungus or from gyms and gym mats. A doctor can usually diagnose ringworm by sight or after performing a skin scraping. Some doctors may also perform afungal cultureto help them determine a diagnosis. Ringworm of the body that’s limited to a few areas can usually be treated with a topical antifungal medication, such as: clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF Ringworm Cream) econazole ketoconazole (Extina, Ketozole) luliconazole (Luzu) naftifine oxiconazole (Oxistat) sulconazole (Exelderm) terbinafine (Lamisil AT Cream, Silka Antifungal Cream) Doctors often recommend oral antifungals for a deeper or more extensive infection. They include: fluconazole (Diflucan) itraconazole (Sporanox) terbinafine If you think you may have ringworm, try to refrain from using over-the-counter antifungal products (such as creams) before you receive an official diagnosis. Using these products can make the fungus harder to identify when a healthcare professional views it under a microscope. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), over-the-counter antifungal products aren’t effective against ringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis). This type of ringworm typically requires prescription antifungal products. This fungal infection affects the skin of the scalp and the associated hair shafts. It’s most common in children and teens3 to 14 years old. You can contract ringworm of the scalp from animals, soil, or other humans (via hairbrushes or hats). Symptoms ofringworm of the scalp (tinea capitis)can include: broken hair shafts localized bald patches that may appear scaly or red associated scaling anditching associatedtenderness or painin the patches patches that ooze or crust over permanenthair loss, in some severe cases It may resemble severedandruff. It can also cause symptoms unrelated to the scalp, such asfeverandswollen lymph nodes in the neck. A doctor can diagnose ringworm of the scalp during a physical examination. They usually perform a skin scraping, such as askin lesion KOH exam. In the skin lesion KOH exam, skin scrapings are mixed with potassium hydrochloride (KOH) to determine if fungi are present. Ringworm of the scalp requires prescription oral medication, which may come in the form of a tablet, capsule, or liquid. Examples include: fluconazole (Diflucan) griseofulvin(Fulvicin, Gris-PEG), which is typically the drug of choice and is safe for children itraconazole (Sporanox) terbinafine Everyone with ringworm of the scalp should use an antifungal shampoo. All members of their household should use it too. Examples includeketoconazole shampoo(Nizoral Anti-Dandruff Shampoo). Jock itchhappens in the area near yourgroinandthighs. It’s most common in men and adolescent boys. The main symptom is an itchy, red, and sometimes painful rash that typically starts in the groin or around the upper inner thighs. The rash may worsen after exercise or other physical activity and can spread to the buttocks and abdomen. The affected skin may also appear: scaly flaky cracked moist and possiblymacerated, in the case of an open sore The outer border of the rash can be slightly raised and darker. A doctor can diagnose jock itch during a physical examination or after examining a sample under a microscope. Treatment often begins with OTC or prescription creams. OTC creams, sprays, and powders include: butenafine (Lotrimin Ultra Jock Itch Cream) clotrimazole (Lotrimin AF Jock Itch Antifungal Cream) miconazole (CareALL Miconazole Cream, Lotrimin AF Jock Itch Antifungal Powder Spray) terbinafine (Lamisil AT Cream for Jock Itch, Silka Antifungal Cream, Silka Jock Itch Cream) Prescription creams include: econazole ketoconazole (Ketozole) luliconazole (Luzu) oxiconazole (Oxistat) sulconazole (Exelderm) Applying acool compresscan also help soothe the skin. If topical treatments don’t work, a doctor may prescribe oral antifungals, such as: fluconazole (Diflucan) itraconazole (Sporanox) terbinafine Oral medications are typically reserved for recurrent, treatment-resistant, or chronic infections. Intinea versicolor, small oval discolored patches develop on the skin. It’s sometimes called pityriasis versicolor. This infection is caused by an overgrowth of a fungus calledMalassezia.Malasseziais naturally present on the skin of most adults. The discolored skin patches mostly occur on the back, chest, and upper arms, but they can also affect the scalp. They may looklighterordarkerthan the rest of the skin and can be red, pink, tan, or brown. On people with darker skin, the patches may appear white. These patches can be itchy, flaky, or scaly. Tinea versicolor is more likely to appear during the summer or in areas with a warm, wet climate. It’s also common in people who work out orsweatoften. The condition can sometimes return following treatment. A doctor can diagnose tinea versicolor with a: physical examination Wood’s lamp examination, in which a healthcare professional uses a handheld blacklight to confirm the presence of fungi or bacteria skin lesion biopsy, which involves removing a small skin sample and having it tested in a laboratory skin lesion KOH exam The standard treatment for tinea versicolor is topical products such as soaps, creams, lotions, and shampoos. Ingredients to look for include: ketoconazole, found in products such as prescription-strength shampoo and Extina foam pyrithione zinc, found in products such as Vanicream Z-Bar Medicated Cleansing Bar, Vanicream Dandruff Shampoo, and Selsun blue Itchy Dry Scalp Antidandruff Shampoo selenium sulfide, found in products such as Selsun blue Moisturizing Antidandruff Shampoo and Selsun blue Medicated Antidandruff Shampoo If tinea versicolor returns following treatment, a doctor may recommend you use a medicated cleanseronce or twice a month. Oral medication is rarely needed. A doctor may prescribe a short course of oral antifungals if tinea versicolor is recurrent, treatment-resistant, widespread, severe, or creates thick scales. They include: fluconazole (Diflucan) itraconazole (Sporanox) Athlete’s footaffects the skin on your feet, often between your toes. It can also appear on the soles of your feet. Typical symptoms of athlete’s foot include: itchingor aburning, stinging sensation between your toes or on the soles skin that appearsred, scaly, dry, orflaky peeling skin thickened soles crackedorblisteredskin deep blisters on the soles, in rare cases In some cases, the infection can also spread to other areas. Examples include the: nails, as in onychomycosis groin, as in jock itch (tinea cruris) hands, as intinea manuum A doctor can diagnose athlete’s foot by observing your symptoms or performing a skin test such as the skin lesion KOH exam. You can treat athlete’s foot with a variety of OTC topical products, such as: butenafine (Lotrimin Ultra Athlete’s Foot Cream) clotrimazole (CareALL Athlete’s Foot Cream, Lotrimin AF Cream for Athlete’s Foot) miconazole (Desenex Athlete’s Foot Shake Powder) terbinafine (Lamisil AT Cream, Lamisil AT Cream for Athlete’s Foot, Silka Antifungal Cream) tolnaftate (Dr. Scholl’s Odor-X Antifungal Spray Powder, Lotrimin AF Athlete’s Foot Daily Prevention Deodorant Powder Spray, Tinactin Athlete’s Foot Cream) Terbinafine tends to be the fastest-acting of these medications. If OTC products don’t help clear up athlete’s footwithin 2 weeksor so, a doctor may prescribe: prescription-strength topical clotrimazole sulconazole (Exelderm) Doctors usually prescribe oral antifungals when the infection is recurrent, causes blisters, or involves the tops of the feet, soles, or heels. They include: fluconazole (Diflucan) griseofulvin (Fulvicin, Gris-PEG), which is safe for children itraconazole (Sporanox) terbinafine Athlete’s foot tends to recur, so it’s important to dry the toes and feet thoroughly after showering or bathing. Use a powder, especially in between the toes. Onychomycosis is afungal infection of the nails. It can affect the fingernails or the toenails, although infections of the toenails are7 to 10 timesmore common. Symptoms of onychomycosis include nails that: haveflaky white patchesandpitsnear the top arediscolored(typicallyyellow, brown,black, purplish, green, or white) arebrittleor break easily arethick are raised or crusty, in the case of toenails A doctor will usually take a nail clipping and some subfungal debris and send them off for a periodic acid–Schiff (PAS) stain or culture. On some occasions, they may perform a skin lesion KOH exam. However, the PAS stains and cultures are more accurate. Prescription medications are often required to treat this type of infection. The standard treatment is oral terbinafine. It’s typically prescribedfor 6 or 12 weeks, depending on whether you have a fingernail or toenail infection. Treatment is notoriously tricky due to factors such as prolonged treatment time and the likelihood of recurrence. Other oral antifungals that may be used include: fluconazole (Diflucan) griseofulvin (Fulvicin, Gris-PEG), which is safe for children itraconazole (Sporanox) Doctors often prescribe topical antifungals as well. They include: ciclopirox (Ciclodan) efinaconazole (Jublia) tavaborole (Kerydin) In severe cases, a doctor may remove some or all of an affected nail. Emerging treatment options include lasers and light therapy. More data on their effectiveness is needed."
499,Fungal Skin Infection,Fungal skin rash,"Because a rash is a common symptom of most fungal skin infections, they’re often referred to as fungal skin rashes or fungal rashes. Onychomycosis is one of the few fungal skin infections that doesn’t typically cause a rash."
500,Fungal Skin Infection,Risk factors for fungal skin infections,"Several factors can increase your risk of getting a fungal skin infection. They include: living in a warm or wet environment sweating heavily not keeping your skin clean and dry sharing items such as clothing, shoes, towels, or bedding wearing tight clothing or footwear that doesn’t breathe well taking part in activities that involve frequent skin-to-skin contact coming into contact with animals that may be infected having aweakened immune systemdue toimmunosuppressant drugs, cancer treatment, or conditions such as HIV or AIDS"
501,Fungal Skin Infection,Prevention of fungal skin infections,"To help prevent a fungal skin infection from developing, try to keep the following tips in mind: Be sure to practicegood hygiene. Do not share clothing, towels, or other personal items. Wear clean clothes every day, particularly socks and underwear. Choose clothing and shoes that breathe well. Avoid clothing or shoes that are too tight or have a restrictive fit. Make sure to dry off properly with a clean and dry towel after showering, bathing, or swimming. Wear sandals or flip-flops in locker rooms instead of walking with bare feet. Wipe down shared surfaces, such as gym equipment or mats. Stay away from animals that have signs of a fungal infection, such as missing fur or frequent scratching."
502,Fungal Skin Infection,When to contact a doctor,"Fungal skin infections are common. Although these infections aren’t usually serious, they can cause discomfort and irritation due to itchy or scaly red skin. If not treated, the rash may spread or become more irritated. Many fungal skin infections eventually improve in response to OTC fungal treatments. However, call a doctor or other healthcare professional if you: have a fungal skin infection that does not improve, gets worse, or returns after OTC treatment notice patches of hair loss along with itchiness or scaly skin have a weakened immune system and suspect a fungal infection havediabetesand think you haveathlete’s footoronychomycosis If you are immunocompromised or have diabetes, an untreated infection can lead tocellulitisor systemic infection. Also, call a doctor or other healthcare professional if you have an infection that does not improve with OTC medications. You may need a prescription for more effective treatment."
503,Gallbladder,Overview,"Pain is the most common symptom of a gallbladder problem. It can be mild and intermittent or quite severe and frequent. It may begin to radiate to other areas of the body, including the back and chest. Yourgallbladderis a 4-inch, pear-shaped organ positioned under yourliverin the upper right section of yourabdomen. Its job is to storebile, which helps break down fat from food. When there’s a problem with your gallbladder, you’re likely to experience pain, as well as other symptoms. Read on to learn more about the gallbladder and how to identify a problem."
504,Gallbladder,What does it feel like when your gallbladder is bothering you?,"Gallbladder-related pain usually occurs in the mid toupper-rightsection of your abdomen. It tends to be sudden and sharp and doesn’t decrease as you move or adjust posture. The pain may last for at least 30 minutes and be localized on the right upper side of your abdomen, often radiating to the back or right shoulder. That said, many gallbladder problems, such as gallstones, are interconnected. This means that a lot of the signs or symptoms may be similar regardless of the underlying cause. Nausea or vomiting:Chronic gallbladder disease may causedigestive problems, such asacid refluxand gas. Fever or chills:An infection may develop if the common bile duct isobstructed, though there are other causes. It should be treated immediately. Chronic diarrhea:Definedas loose or watery stools that occur more thanthree or moretimes per day and last for four weeks or more. Jaundice:Marked byyellow-tinted skin, this may be a symptom of a block or stone in thecommon bile duct. Stool abnormality:Lighter-colored stoolis a possible symptom of a common bile duct block. Discolored urine:Dark urineis another potential symptom of a common bile duct block."
505,Gallbladder,What causes gallbladder problems?,"Any disease that affects your gallbladder is considered agallbladder disease. Conditionsmay include: Chronicoracutebile ductobstructionorinflammation:This, in turn, may be caused by:gallstonesbile duct stonesinfectiontraumacystsparasitestumors gallstones bile duct stones infection trauma cysts parasites tumors Porcelain gallbladder: This occurs whencalcium depositsstiffen the gallbladder walls, making them rigid. Abscess of the gallbladder:This leads topusin the gallbladder (empyema). If not diagnosed and treated, it can become life threatening as the infection spreads to other parts of the body. Gallstone ileus: A gallstone may travel into the intestine andblock it.This condition israrebut can be fatal. It’s most common among individuals who are over age 65. Perforated gallbladder:Also known as aruptured gallbladder,this is another life threatening condition that could lead to a dangerous, widespread abdominal infection if the tear isn’t detected. Gallbladder polyps:Gallbladder polypsmay be benign, but larger ones may need to be surgically removed before they develop intocanceror cause other problems. Polyps can also cause obstruction of the gallbladder. Gallbladder cancer:Although rare,gallbladder cancercan spread quickly if not detected and treated. You may be more likely to develop it if you have chronic inflammation in your gallbladder or bile duct problems. Acalculous gallbladder disease: This is when you experience the symptoms of gallstones without having them."
506,Gallbladder,How are gallbladder problems diagnosed?,"A doctor may discuss your medical history, symptoms, and family history. They may also ask about your diet and nutrition. Then, they typically perform a physical exam to locate pain in the abdomen and order a blood test. Results from ablood testmay indicate an infection or inflammation in the gallbladder, bile ducts, pancreas, or even the liver. Imaging tests can help identify gallstones in your gallbladder. Imaging testscan include: Ultrasound:Agallbladder ultrasoundis considered the best imaging test for finding gallstones. Computed tomography (CT) scan:This combination of X-rays and technology can show gallstones and reveal complications such as blockage of the gallbladder or bile ducts. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI):Agallbladder MRIshows detailed images of your body’s organs and can show gallstones in your biliary tract ducts. Cholescintigraphy:Also known as aHIDA scan, this test can show gallbladder abnormalities and blockages in the bile ducts. Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP):AnERCPis a more invasive procedure that is often used to address an existing problem, such as a gallstone stuck in the common bile duct. Once the doctor has performed any necessary tests, they may make a diagnosis, followed by a recommended course of treatment."
507,Gallbladder,How are gallbladder problems treated?,"If a doctor discovers stones in your gallbladder and you experience symptoms, you might havegallbladder removal surgery. That said, gallstones without symptoms do not need surgery. It’s also not the only way to treat a gallbladder problem. Depending on your issue and diagnosis, your treatment may include: over-the-counter (OTC)pain relievers, such as ibuprofen (Aleve, Motrin) antibiotics for infection anti-inflammatory medications lithotripsy, a procedure that uses shock waves to break apart gallstones and other masses surgery to remove gallstones You may also find pain relief withnatural remedies, such as exercise and a heated compress. This may also includeadjusting your diet. In addition, if you have gallbladder removal surgery, a doctor may advisedietary changesboth before (pre-op) and after surgery (post-op)."
508,Gallbladder,When should you see a doctor?,"Symptoms of a gallbladder problem may come and go. However, you’re more likely to develop a gallbladder problem if you’ve had one before. While gallbladder problems are rarely deadly, they should still be treated. You can prevent gallbladder problems from worsening by getting medical care. Symptoms that should prompt you to seek immediate medical attention include: severe, frequent, or constant abdominal pain jaundice pale stools sweating, low grade fever, or chills, if the above symptoms accompany them"
509,Gallbladder,Takeaway,"The most common indication that you may be experiencing a problem with your gallbladder is pain in the mid toupper-rightsection of your abdomen. Gallstones may be responsible for the pain, and depending on the severity of your symptoms and imaging results, a doctor may recommend gallbladder removal surgery."
510,Gallstones,Overview,"Gallstones are hard, crystalized deposits of digestive fluid made of substances found in bile, like cholesterol. If they cause symptoms, you may need to have your gallbladder removed. The gallbladder is a small organ in the upper right abdomen, right below your liver. It’s a pouch that stores bile, a green-yellow liquid that helps digestion. Gallbladder issues typically occur when something is blocking the bile duct opening in the gallbladder. Gallstones are formed when substances found in bile,such asbilirubin and cholesterol, crystalize and harden. They’re very common and routinely asymptomatic. However, around1 in 10 peoplewith gallstones will develop noticeable symptoms within 5 years. Keep reading to learn more about the symptoms, causes, and treatments for gallstones."
511,Gallstones,Symptoms of gallstones,"In most cases, gallstones don’t cause any symptoms and are only identified during a routine checkup. Gallstones themselves don’t usually cause symptoms until they block the movement of bile from the gallbladder (biliary obstruction). This may cause sudden, sharp pain in the abdomen that can radiate to the back or shoulder blade. This is sometimescalledagallbladder attack, or biliary colic. It can last up to5 hours. Abdominal pain will usually go away once the gallstones clear the gallbladder duct. Learn more:What does gallbladder pain feel like? It’s important to get immediate medical attention if you experience any of thefollowing symptoms: nausea vomiting fever yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes (jaundice) These symptoms could be a sign ofgallbladder complicationsor other serious medical conditions, such aspancreatitis,appendicitis, andgastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD)."
512,Gallstones,Causes,"The cause of gallstones is thought to be due to having too much cholesterol or bilirubin in yourgallbladder. Cholesterol:Too muchcholesterolin your bile can lead to yellow cholesterol stones, which may develop if your liver makes more cholesterol than your bile can dissolve. Approximately4 in 5 gallstonesare made from cholesterol. Bilirubin:Thischemicalis produced during the normal breakdown of red blood cells. After bilirubin is created, it passes through the liver and is excreted out of the body. These hard stones are often dark brown or black and form when your gallbladder can’t break down the excess bilirubin. Gallstones may also happen if your gallbladder fails to properly empty its bile content. This bile can become overly concentrated, causing stones to form. Gallbladder symptoms can sometimes happenafter eatinghigh fat foods, too."
513,Gallstones,Treatment,"In most cases, you won’t need treatment because gallstones are usually asymptomatic. Sometimes you can pass gallstones without even noticing. However, if you’re experiencing pain, a doctor may recommend treatment. Treatment for gallstones usuallyinvolvesa surgery calledlaparoscopic cholecystectomy, which is the removal of your gallbladder. Because the gallbladder isn’t an essential organ, it’s possible to live a healthy life without it. A doctor may recommend an open cholecystectomy if your gallbladder is inflamed, infected, or scarred. This surgery may also happen if problems occur during a laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Removing a gallbladder involves rerouting the bile from the liver to the small intestine. The immediate result is a laxative effect that may cause diarrhea, but this should resolve for most people. Learn more aboutgallbladder removal surgeryandlife after gallbladder removal surgery. A doctor may recommend nonsurgical treatments to help remove gallstones if you can’t tolerate surgery. However, because the gallbladder isn’t being removed, you’re at risk of developing gallstones again. Some nonsurgical treatments for gallstones may include: endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) shock wave lithotripsy bile duct drain medications taken by mouth"
514,Gallstones,Risk factors for gallstones,"Researchers have identifiedseveral risk factorsfor gallstones. Some of these are controllable, while others aren’t. Risk factors for gallstones may include: older age being assigned female at birth having a medical condition, such asobesity,Crohn’s disease,cirrhosis, andsickle cell anemia having a gallbladder infection eating a diet high in fat or cholesterol and low in fiber undergoing rapid weight loss being of Native American or Mexican descent having a family history of gallstones being pregnant taking medications with a high estrogen content, such asbirth control While some medications may increase your risk of gallstones, don’t stop taking them unless you have discussed it with a doctor and have their approval."
515,Gallstones,Diagnosis,"A doctor will perform a medical history and physical examination, which mayincludepressing down on your abdomen to check for inflammation. The exam may also involve using other diagnostic tests to help rule out other conditions that may be causing your symptoms and to see inside your body. These testsinclude: ultrasound abdominal CT scan cholangiogram MRI scan gallbladder radionuclide scan blood tests"
516,Gallstones,Prevention tips,"There’s no foolproof way to prevent gallstones. However, the following lifestyle and dietary changes mayhelp managecholesterol levels, which play a role in gallstones: exercise regularly eat awell-balanced diet, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains limit foodshigh in saturated fats, such as processed meats, cakes, cookies, lard, cream, cheeses, and oils maintain amoderate weight gradually lose weightif you haveobesityor overweight If you’re unsure of where to begin with gallbladder prevention, speak with a healthcare professional or registered dietitian. They could help develop an exercise and dietary plan for you."
517,Gallstones,Complications,"In rare cases, gallstones may lead to serious complications if they block a bile duct. Some complications mayinclude: gallbladder inflammation (cholecystitis) bile duct inflammation or infection (cholangitis) jaundice pancreatitis gallbladder cancer gallbladder obstruction (ileus)"
518,Gallstones,Long-term outlook,"If you undergo gallbladder surgery, your outlook is most often positive. For instance, less than0.5%of people who get laparoscopic surgery have fatal complications. If you aren’t able to have surgery and decide to take medication to dissolve the stones, the gallstones may return, so you and a doctor will need to monitor your progress."
519,Gallstones,Frequently asked questions,"Gallstones can sometimes pass through your digestive system on their own. However, you’ll most likely need treatment to get rid of them if they’re causing symptoms. Gallstones most often don’t cause any symptoms. However, if they block your gallbladder duct, you may experience severe abdominal pain that could last up to5 hours. In most cases, you only require gallstone treatment if you experience symptoms. Sometimes, untreated gallstones may lead tocomplicationslike pancreatitis, jaundice, and gallbladder infection or inflammation."
520,Gallstones,The bottom line,"Gallstones are deposits made in your gallbladder from substances found in bile, such as cholesterol and bilirubin. Most people don’t experience any symptoms of gallstones, but they could cause severe abdominal pain if they get caught in a bile duct. Speak with a healthcare professional if you experience gallbladder symptoms accompanied by nausea, fever, and vomiting. They could provide a proper diagnosis and treatment plan for you."
521,Genital Herpes,Overview,"Most people have a form of the herpes simplex virus (HSV). HSV does not always cause symptoms, but it’s important to get tested if you develop unusual pain, swelling, or sores around the genitals or anus. Genital herpes is a common sexually transmitted infection (STI). When symptoms occur, it’s considered a sexually transmitted disease (STD). Herpetic sores are painful blisters (fluid-filled bumps) that can break open and ooze fluid."
522,Genital Herpes,What causes genital herpes?,"Two types of theherpes simplex virus (HSV)cause genital herpes: HSV-1usually causescold sores, but it can also cause genital herpes. HSV-2usually causes genital herpes, but it can also cause cold sores. The virus is usually transmitted through intimate skin-to-skin contact. However, it can also be spread through bodily fluids, including: breast milk saliva semen vaginal secretions The viruses enter the body throughskin abrasionsor mucous membranes. Mucous membranes are the thin layers of tissue that line the openings of your body. They can be found in your nose, mouth, anus, and genitals. Once the viruses are inside the body, they incorporate themselves into the cells. Viruses tend to multiply or adapt to their environments very easily, which makes treating them difficult."
523,Genital Herpes,What does a herpes sore look like?,"Herpes sores initially look like small pus-filled bumps, similar to pimples or blisters. These sores can break open and ooze liquid, which forms a crust. One sore might be on its own, or there might be a cluster of sores. Herpes sores can occur on the skin in or around the mouth (cold sores) or around the genitals or anus."
524,Genital Herpes,How do you recognize the symptoms of genital herpes?,"The appearance of blisters is known as an outbreak. Some people experience an initial outbreak anywhere from 2 to 20 days after exposure to HSV. The affected area may start to itch or tingle before blisters appear on or around the: anus buttocks groin (where the lower abdomen meets the inner thigh) gums labia mouth penis mons pubis (pubic mound) scrotum vaginal opening vulva The blisters may become ulcerated (open sores) and ooze fluid. A crust may appear over the sores within a week of the outbreak. You may also develop swollenlymph glands, headaches, body aches, and fever. However, many people do not experience any symptoms for months or even years. If symptoms do occur, an initial outbreak usually lasts 2 to 4 weeks. The length of an outbreak usually lessens over time. It’s important to understand that even if the symptoms disappear, the virus is still present in the body and can be transmitted to others."
525,Genital Herpes,How is genital herpes diagnosed?,"Make an appointment with a healthcare professional if you suspect that you’ve been exposed to HSV or develop unusual sores.If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here. A blood test can detect HSV before a potential outbreak occurs. However, if you’re experiencing visible symptoms, a healthcare professional may be able to make a diagnosis based on a visual exam. They may also swab the affected area to collect a sample for testing. If an in-person appointment isn’t an option, anat-home test kitis another option to consider."
526,Genital Herpes,How is genital herpes treated?,"Although there’s no cure for herpes, it can be treated with medication. Antiviral drugs may help speed up the healing time for sores and reduce pain. Medications may be taken at the first signs of an outbreak (tingling, itching, and other symptoms) to help reduce the symptoms. Use mild cleansers when bathing or showering in warm water. Keep the affected site clean and dry. Wear loose cotton clothing to keep the area comfortable."

528,Genital Herpes,The bottom line,"HSV is primarily transmitted through sexual activity. The virus stays dormant within the body until something triggers an outbreak. Outbreaks can happen due to stress, sickness, or fatigue. It’s important to get tested if you have unusual symptoms or suspect that you’ve been exposed. You may be able to get free or lower cost STI screening at your local health department, community clinic, or Planned Parenthood. There isn’t a cure for HSV, but the condition can be managed with antiviral medication. Many people do not experience symptoms after an initial outbreak, if at all."
529,GERD,Overview,"Many people may experience acid reflux, indigestion, or heartburn from time to time. However, if you experience acid reflux symptoms more than twice per week, you may have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which affects about 20% of people in the United States. GERD commonly causes acid reflux, which may result from improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The LES is a circular band of muscle at the end of your esophagus that normally tightens and closes after allowing food to pass through. Treatment options include lifestyle measures (like avoiding trigger foods, maintaining moderate weight, avoiding smoking), medications (such as proton pump inhibitors, antacids, H2 receptor blockers), and in some cases, surgery may be recommended if other approaches haven’t stopped symptoms. Many people may experience acid reflux, indigestion, or heartburn from time to time. However, if you experience acid reflux symptoms more than twice per week, you may havegastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Estimates suggest GERD potentially affectsup to 6.8 million Canadians. If left untreated, it may lead to serious complications. Read on to learn more about the symptoms, causes, and treatments for GERD. Heartburn can happen for many reasons, like eating certain foods or even taking some medications. Over-the-counter (OTC) products may help ease the discomfort. Gaviscon® Extra Strength Fruit Blend Antacid Tabletsare formulated for heartburn, acid reflux, and GERD relief — day or night. They are designed to provide fast-acting, long-lasting relief from symptoms.* *sponsored"
530,GERD,Symptoms of GERD,"The most commonsymptom of GERDis persistent heartburn, which may involve: a burning feeling in your stomach that may rise to your chest, neck, and throat a sour or bitter taste at the back of your mouth regurgitation of food or liquid from your stomach into your mouth Other possible symptoms of GERD include: a feeling of fullness or of a lump in the back of your throat (globus sensation) chronic cough a hoarse voice bad breath In some cases, people may experiencealarmsymptoms associated with GERD. These are typically persistent and could progressively worsen despite medical treatment. Alarm symptoms may also indicate an underlying condition. Alarm symptoms may include: difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) pain when swallowing (odynophagia) nauseaor vomiting weight loss anemia bleeding If you’re experiencing any of these, get medical attention. Heartburn andheart attacksaretwo common causesof chest pain. However, their causes and sensations are typically different: Heartburnmay occur when acidic contents of your stomach move back up into your esophagus. This may cause a burning sensation that rises from your stomach and radiates into your chest. Heart attackis when your heart doesn’t get enough blood and oxygen due to a reduced flow of blood in one or more major arteries. This may cause sudden, uncomfortable, or sharp pain in the center or left side of your chest that feels like pressure or squeezing. It could spread to your neck, jaw, and shoulder too. If you’re feeling anyheart attack symptoms, such as shortness of breath or faintness, get medical assistance immediately. It’s normal for babies to sometimes spit up food or vomit. But if your baby is frequently spitting or vomiting, they may have GERD. Other signs and symptoms of GERD in infants might include: refusal to eat trouble swallowing gagging or choking wet burps or hiccups irritability or arching of the back during or after feeding weight loss or poor growth recurring cough or pneumonia difficulty sleeping If you suspect that your baby might have GERD or another health condition, speak with a doctor."
531,GERD,Causes of GERD,"GERD commonly causes acid reflux, which may result from improper functioning of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES). The LES is a circular band of muscle at the end of youresophagus. When you swallow, it relaxes and opens up to allow food and liquid to travel from your mouth to your stomach. Then, it tightens and closes again. Acid reflux happens when your LES doesn’t tighten or close properly. This allows digestive juices and other contents of your stomach to rise up into your esophagus. Your LES may not function properly if you: Have a hiatal hernia:This occurs when part of your stomachmoves above your diaphragmtoward your chest. If your diaphragm is compromised, it may prevent your LES from functioning properly. Frequently eat large meals:This may cause distension of the upper part of your stomach. This distension sometimes means there isn’t enough pressure on the LES, and it doesn’t close properly. Lie down too soon after meals:This might not create enough pressure for the LES to function properly. Otherfactors, including those listed below, may also contribute to having heartburn more than twice a week. Lifestyle factors that may contribute to persistent reflux with esophageal inflammation include: smokingor being exposed to secondhand smoke eating large meals before lying down using an abundance ofnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugssuch as aspirin and ibuprofen Health factors such as the following may contribute to GERD: obesity pregnancy connective tissue disorders older age Other health conditions that can worsen the symptoms of GERD include: anxiety pregnancy asthma irritable bowel syndrome Studies suggest that drinking alcohol mayincreasethe risk of GERD. The greater the quantity of alcohol and frequency of consumption, the greater the correlation. If you’ve received a diagnosis of GERD, limiting or stopping alcohol intake may provide symptom relief. Somefoodsmay trigger GERD symptoms more than others, including: high fat foods such as fried and fast foods spicy foods certain fruits and vegetables, such as pineapple, tomato, and citrus certain liquids, such as coffee, tea, and carbonated drinks"
532,GERD,Diagnosis,"A doctor will typically take your medical history and perform aphysical examinationto assess your symptoms. If you’re experiencing alarm symptoms, such as chest pain or trouble swallowing, they may refer you to agastroenterologistor request certain tests, including: Ambulatory 24-hour pH probe:A small tube is inserted through your nose into your esophagus. A pH sensor at the tip of the tube measures how much acid exposure your esophagus is getting and sends the data to a portable computer. You wear this tube for about 24 hours. Esophagram:After you drink abarium solution, healthcare professionals use X-ray imaging to examine your upper digestive tract. Upper endoscopy:A flexible tube with atiny camerais threaded into your esophagus to examine it and collect a tissue sample (biopsy) if needed. Esophageal manometry:A flexible tube is passed through your nose into your esophagus tomeasurethe strength of your esophageal muscles. Esophageal pH monitoring:A monitor is inserted into your esophagus to help healthcare professionals find out how acid is regulated in your body over a few days. After arriving at a diagnosis, your doctor will speak with you to decide what treatment plan will work best for you."
533,GERD,Treatment for GERD,"To manage and relieve symptoms of GERD, certainhome remediesand lifestyle habits may help, including: breathing exercises consumingfoodsandliquidsthat may help with your acid reflux making efforts to maintain a moderate weight quitting smoking, if you smoke avoiding eating big, heavy meals in the evening waiting 2–3 hours after eating to lie down elevating your head during sleep If lifestyle strategies alone don’t help treat GERD, a doctor might prescribe medications to decrease your stomach acid secretion, since acid reflux is a common manifestation of GERD. These may include: proton pump inhibitors antacids H2 receptor blockers Consult a doctor before taking medications because they may have negative side effects. In most cases, lifestyle strategies and medications are enough to prevent and relieve symptoms of GERD. However, a doctor might recommend surgery if these approaches haven’t stopped your symptoms or if you’ve developed complications. Possiblesurgery optionsinclude: fundoplication LINX reflux management system bariatric surgery"
534,GERD,Complications of untreated GERD,"For most people, GERD doesn’t cause serious complications. However, in rare cases, it may lead to serious or life threatening health problems such as: esophagitis, which is inflammation of your esophagus esophageal stricture, which happens when your esophagus narrows or tightens Barrett’s esophagus, which involves permanent changes to the lining of your esophagus esophageal cancer, which affects a small portion of people with Barrett’s esophagus tooth enamel erosion, gum disease, or other dental problems To lower your chances of complications, it’s important to take the steps to prevent, manage, and treat symptoms of GERD."
535,GERD,Frequently asked questions,"Only a healthcare professional may provide an accurate GERD diagnosis. If you’re experiencing acid reflux symptoms or indigestion more than twice per week, you may have GERD. A healthcare professional may want to assess your symptoms, perform a physical exam, and consider your medical history to rule out other possible causes. Not everyone experiences the same symptoms of GERD or with the same intensity. Also, there’s not a specific number of symptoms of the condition. The most common GERD symptom is persistent acid reflux, which may involve a burning feeling in your upper stomach, chest, or throat, a sour or bitter taste in your mouth, and regurgitation of food or liquid back into your mouth. Chronic cough, a hoarse voice, nausea, pain swallowing, and weight loss may also be symptoms of GERD. Other conditions may cause symptoms similar to those of GERD. For example,peptic ulcers,esophagitis(inflammation of the food pipe),gallstones,anxiety,hiatal hernias, andesophageal cancer. A healthcare professional can help you explore possible causes of acid reflux and related symptoms. GERD may start as mild and infrequent symptoms (stage 1) and progress to moderate symptoms that present at least twice per week (stage 2). Unmanaged GERD could advance to habitual and severe acid reflux symptoms with a persistent cough and changes to your voice (stage 3). Although rare, some people may enter a fourth stage with severe symptoms that turn into precancerous lesions in the esophagus (food pipe) and throat. Following the advice of a healthcare professional may help you heal GERD permanently or manage symptoms. Strategies may include dietary changes, medications, and lifestyle modifications. For example, avoiding trigger foods and liquids, managing your weight, not using tobacco, limiting alcohol intake, and waiting 2–3 hours after eating to lie down. If these don’t help, you may need surgery."
536,GERD,Takeaway,"If you experience heartburn every so often, you’re not alone. Lifestyle changes and over-the-counter medications are usually enough to address these occasional instances. But if you’re experiencing heartburn more than twice per week and small lifestyle changes are not helping, you may be dealing with GERD. If you’ve received a diagnosis of GERD, your doctor will help you find a treatment plan that works for you. Don’t let persistent heartburn get in the way of living your life. Talk with a doctor if you believe you may have symptoms of GERD."
537,Gingivitis,Overview,"Gingivitis typically develops due to a bacterial infection caused by plaque overgrowth. Other viral or fungal infections may also cause it. Treatment can depend on the severity. Gingivitis is an inflammation of the gums, usually caused by a bacterial infection. If left untreated, it can become a more serious infection known as periodontitis. Gingivitis andperiodontitisare major causes of tooth loss in adults, according to theAmerican Dental Association."
538,Gingivitis,Types of gum infections,"Gingivitis is usually caused by an overgrowth of dental plaque. In addition to improper dental hygiene, there can be many contributing factors, such as: certain medications, such asphenytoin,cyclosporine,calcium channel blockers, andoral or injectable birth control(these medications can cause gingivitis or make it worse because they can lead to an overgrowth of gum tissue and make plaque hard to remove) severedeficiencies of vitamin C(this is rare in the United States) hormonal changes, including duringpregnancyandmenopause leukemia heavy metals like nickel, which can be found in some jewelry exposure to bismuth, which can be found in some makeup There are some types of gingivitis-causing gum infections that are not related to plaque overgrowth. These include: certain viral or fungal infections, such asthrush animpacted tooth, or tooth that doesn’t fully emerge (if this happens, the flap of gum over the tooth can trap debris and cause gingivitis)"
539,Gingivitis,What causes gingivitis?,"Your gums actually attach to the teeth at a lower point than the gum edges we see. This forms a small space called a sulcus. Food and plaque can get trapped in this space and cause a gum infection or gingivitis. Plaqueis a thin film of bacteria. It constantly forms on the surface of your teeth. As plaque advances, it hardens and becomestartar. You can develop a gum infection when plaque extends below the gum line. If left unchecked, gingivitis can cause the gums to separate from the teeth. This can cause: injury to the soft tissue and bone supporting the teeth the tooth to become loose and unstable the loss of the tooth, if infection progresses"
540,Gingivitis,Risk factors for gingivitis,"The following are risk factors for gingivitis and periodontitis: smokingor chewing tobacco diabetes certain medications, such as:oral contraceptivessteroidsanticonvulsantscalcium channel blockerschemotherapy oral contraceptives steroids anticonvulsants calcium channel blockers chemotherapy crooked teeth improper fit ondental appliances broken fillings pregnancy genetic factors suppressed immunity, such as withHIV Optum Now is operated by RVO Health.

541,Gingivitis,What are the symptoms of gingivitis and periodontitis?,"Many people aren’t aware that they have gum disease. It’s possible to have gingivitis without any symptoms. However, the following can be symptoms of gum disease: gums that are red, tender, or swollen gums that bleed when you brush or floss your teeth gums that have pulled away from your teeth loose teeth a change in how your teeth fit together when you bite (malocclusion) pus between your teeth and gums pain when chewing sensitive teeth partial denturesthat no longer fit foul-smelling breath that doesn’t go away after you brush your teeth"
542,Gingivitis,When to see a dentist,"It’s important to contact a dentist if you think you might have gum disease because it can still be reversed at early stages. Contact a dentist if you have any symptoms of gum disease. Early signs are usually gums that are red, swollen, and bleeding easily. If you need help finding a dentist, then check out our FindCare tool here."
543,Gingivitis,How is gingivitis diagnosed?,"During a dental exam, your gums will be probed with a small ruler. This probing is a way to check for inflammation. It measures any pockets around your teeth. A typical depth is 1 to 3 millimeters. Your dentist may also order X-rays to check for bone loss. Speak with your dentist about risk factors for gum disease, as well as your symptoms. This can help diagnose gingivitis. If gingivitis is present, you may be referred to a periodontist. A periodontist is a dentist who specializes in the treatment of gum diseases."
544,Gingivitis,How is gingivitis treated?,"You must practicegood oral hygieneto treat gingivitis. You should also cut back on any smoking if you smoke and manage your diabetes if you live with this condition. Quitting smoking may be difficult, but a doctor can help build acessation planthat works for you. Other treatments include: deep cleaning your teeth antibiotic medications surgery There are several techniques that can be used to deep clean your teeth without surgery. They all remove plaque and tartar to prevent gum irritation: Scaling.Teeth scalingremoves tartar from above and below the gum line. Root planing. This smooths rough spots and removes plaque and tartar from the root surface. Lasers. This treatment may remove tartar with less pain and bleeding than scaling and root planing. A number of medications can be used to treat gum disease: Antiseptic mouthwashcontaining chlorhexidine can be used to disinfect your mouth. Timed-release antiseptic chipscontaining chlorhexidine can be inserted into pockets after root planing. Antibiotic microspheresmade with minocycline can be inserted into pockets after scaling and planing. Oral antibioticscan be used to treat persistent areas of gum inflammation. Doxycycline, an antibiotic, can help keep enzymes from causing tooth damage. If your gingivitis is severe, especially if it’s caused any gum or bone tissue loss, you may need surgery. Types of gum surgery, which is performed by a periodontist, include: Flap surgery.Flap surgeryis a procedure where the gums are lifted back while plaque and tartar is removed from deeper pockets. The gums are thensuturedin place to fit snugly around the tooth. Bone and tissue grafts.Grafting can be used when your teeth and jaw are too damaged to heal.Gum graftsurgery uses tissue from the roof of your mouth to cover the exposed tooth root. This helps prevent additional gum and bone loss.For abone graft, your doctor will start with a procedure similar to flap surgery, but they’ll put in a bone graft to encourage your body to regenerate any lost jaw bone. Gum graftsurgery uses tissue from the roof of your mouth to cover the exposed tooth root. This helps prevent additional gum and bone loss. For abone graft, your doctor will start with a procedure similar to flap surgery, but they’ll put in a bone graft to encourage your body to regenerate any lost jaw bone. Dental crown lengthening.Some people with gingivitis may have excess gum tissue. If this is the case, a periodontist canreshape your gum and bone tissueto expose more of your teeth. This may also be necessary before certain cosmetic or restorative procedures on your teeth."
545,Gingivitis,How can gum disease be prevented?,Proper and consistent oral hygiene can prevent gum disease. This includes: visiting the dentist regularly brushing your teeth twice daily withfluoridetoothpaste flossing your teeth every day Eating abalanced dietis also important to achieving and maintaining dental health.
546,Gingivitis,Health conditions associated with gum disease,"TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)and theNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Researchreport that periodontal disease is associated with an increased risk for: diabetes heart disease stroke lung disease It also increases the risk of a person giving birth to a premature or low birth weight infant. Although gum disease is associated with these health conditions, it hasn’t been shown to cause them. More research is needed to determine the specifics of this association."
547,Gout,Overview,"Gout can be treated and managed with medications and healthy lifestyle habits. Your doctor or nutritionist can help you develop the best treatment strategy for you. Gout is a general term for a variety of conditions caused by abuildup of uric acid. This buildup usually affects the feet. If you have gout, you’ll probably feel swelling and pain in the joints of your foot, particularly your big toe. Sudden and intense pain, or gout attacks, can make it feel like your foot is on fire."
548,Gout,Symptoms of gout,"Some people have too much uric acid in their blood but nosymptoms. This is called asymptomatichyperuricemia. For acute gout, symptoms come on quickly from the buildup of uric acid crystals in your joint and last for 3 to 10 days. You’ll have intense pain and swelling, and your joint may feel warm. Between gout attacks, you won’t have any symptoms. If you don’t treat gout, it can become chronic. Hard lumps called tophi can eventually develop in your joints and the skin and soft tissue surrounding them. These deposits can permanently damage your joints. Prompt treatment is important to prevent gout from turning chronic."
549,Gout,Gout pictures,
550,Gout,Gout home remedies,Somehome remediesmay help lower uric acid levels and prevent gout attacks. The following foods and drinks have been suggested for gout: tartcherries magnesium ginger dilutedapple cider vinegar celery nettle tea dandelion milk thistle seeds But these alone may not be enough to manage gout.
551,Gout,Treatment of gout,"If left untreated, gout can eventually lead to gouty arthritis, which is a more severe form ofarthritis. This painful condition can leave your joint permanently damaged and swollen. The treatment plan your doctor recommends will depend on the stage and severity of your gout. Medicationsto treat gout work in one of two ways: They relieve pain and bring down inflammation, or they prevent future gout attacks by lowering uric acid levels. Drugs to relieve gout pain include: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin (Bufferin), ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin), and naproxen (Aleve) colchicine(Colcrys, Mitigare) corticosteroids Drugs that prevent gout attacks include: xanthine oxidase inhibitors, such asallopurinol(Lopurin, Zyloprim) and febuxostat (Uloric) probenecid (Probalan) Along with medications, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes to help manage your symptoms and reduce your risk of future gout attacks. For example, your doctor may encourage you to: reduce your alcohol intake, if you drink lose weight, if you’re overweight quit smoking, if you smoke In addition a fewcomplementary therapieshave also shown promise."
552,Gout,Gout surgery,"Gout can typically be treated withoutsurgery. But after many years, this condition can damage the joints, tear the tendons, and cause infections in the skin over the joints. Hard deposits, called tophi, can build up on your joints and in other places, like your ear. These lumps may be painful and swollen, and they can permanently damage your joints. Three surgical procedures treat tophi: tophi removal surgery joint fusion surgery joint replacement surgery Which one of these surgeries your doctor recommends depends on the extent of the damage, where the tophi are located, and your personal preferences."
553,Gout,Causes of gout,"The buildup of uric acid in your blood from the breakdown of purines causes gout. Certain conditions, such as blood and metabolism disorders or dehydration, make your body produce too much uric acid. A kidney or thyroid problem, or an inherited disorder, can make it harder for your body to remove excess uric acid. You’re more likely to get gout if you: are a middle-aged man or postmenopausal woman have parents, siblings, or other family members with gout drink alcohol take medications such asdiureticsandcyclosporine have a condition likehigh blood pressure,kidney disease,thyroid disease,diabetes, orsleep apnea For some people, gout is caused by consuming foods that arehigh in gout-producing purines."
554,Gout,Foods to avoid,"Certain foods are naturally high in purines, which your body breaks down into uric acid. Most people can tolerate high-purine foods. But if your body has trouble releasing excess uric acid, you may want to avoid certain foods and drinks, such as: red meats organ meats certain seafood alcohol Sugar-sweetened beverages and foods containing the sugar fructose can also be problematic, even though they don’t contain purines. Some foodshelp reduce uric acid levelsin the body and are good choices if you have gout. Alcohol, like red meat and seafood, is high in purines. When your body breaks down purines, the process releases uric acid. More uric acid increases your risk of having gout. Alcohol can also reduce the rate at which your body removes uric acid. Not everyone who drinks will develop gout. But a high consumption of alcohol (more than 12 drinks per week) can increase the risk — especially in men. Beer is more likely than liquor to influence the risk. In surveys, people have reported that drinking alcohol triggers their gout flare-ups."
555,Gout,Gout diagnosis,"Your doctor candiagnose goutbased on a review of your medical history, a physical exam, and your symptoms. Your doctor will likely base your diagnosis on: your description of your joint pain how often you’ve experienced intense pain in your joint how red or swollen the area is Your doctor may also order a test to check for a buildup of uric acid in your joint. A sample of fluid taken from your joint can show whether it contains uric acid. They may also want to take an X-ray of your joint. If you have symptoms of gout, you can start with a visit to your primary care doctor. If your gout is severe, you may need to see a specialist in joint diseases. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
556,Gout,Gout triggers,"Certain foods, medications, and conditions canset off gout symptoms. You may need to avoid or limit foods and drinks like these, which are high in purines: red meat, such as pork and veal organ meats fish, such as cod, scallops, mussels, and salmon alcohol sodas fruit juice Some medications you take to manage other conditions increase the level of uric acid in your blood. Talk with your doctor if you take any of these drugs: diuretics, or water pills aspirin blood pressure-lowering medications, such as beta-blockers and angiotensin II receptor blockers Your health may also be a factor in flare-ups. All of these conditions have been linked to gout: obesity diabetes or prediabetes dehydration joint injury infections congestive heart failure high blood pressure kidney disease Sometimes it can be hard to pinpoint which of these factors is behind your gout attacks. Keeping a diary is one way to track your diet, medications, and health to help identify the cause of your symptoms."
557,Gout,Gout prevention,"Here are a few steps you can take to help prevent gout: Limit how much alcohol you drink. Limit how much purine-rich food, such as shellfish, lamb, beef, pork, and organ meat, you eat. Eat a low-fat, nondairy diet that’s rich in vegetables. Maintain a healthy weight. Avoid smoking. Exercise regularly. Stay hydrated. If you have medical conditions or take medications that raise your risk of gout, ask your doctor how you can lower your risk of gout attacks."
558,Gout,Gout with tophus,"When uric acid crystals build up in joints for a long time, they produce hard deposits calledtophiunder the skin. Without treatment, these tophi can damage bone and cartilage and leave the joints permanently disfigured. Tophi are swollen lumps around the joints that look like knots on a tree trunk. They occur in joints like the fingers, feet, and knees, as well as on the ears. Tophi themselves don’t hurt, but the inflammation they cause can be painful. Sometimes tophi form in connective tissue outside the joints."
559,Gout,Is gout painful?,"Yes, gout can be painful. In fact, pain in the big toe is often one of the first symptoms people report. The pain is accompanied by more typical arthritis symptoms, such as swelling and warmth in the joints. Gout pain can vary in severity. Pain in the big toe can be very intense at first. After the acute attack, it may subside to a dull ache. The pain, as well as swelling and other symptoms, are the result of the body launching a defense (by theimmune system) against uric acid crystals in the joints. This attack leads to the release of chemicals called cytokines, which promote painful inflammation."
560,Gout,Gout essential oils,"Essential oilsare plant-based substances used in aromatherapy. Some oils are thought to have anti-inflammatory, pain-relieving, and antibacterial effects. Some of theessential oils used to treat goutinclude: lemongrass oil celery seed oil yarrow oil extract olive leaf extract Chinese cinnamon Talk with your doctor before you begin using any essential oil. Be aware that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t regulate the purity or quality of essential oils, so research the brand. Be sure to follow these safety precautions when using essential oils: Don’t put essential oils directly on your skin. It’s important to dilute them first with acarrier oilsuch as coconut oil or jojoba oil. For example, for a 3 percent dilution, mix 20 drops of the essential oil with 6 teaspoons of the carrier oil. Don’t put essential oils in your mouth, since they’re not safe to ingest. Store essential oils and carrier oils in a cool, dark place, away from sunlight and heat."
561,Gout,Is gout hereditary?,"Gout is at least partly due to heredity. Researchers have found dozens of genes that increase people’s susceptibility to gout, includingSLC2A9andABCG2. Genes associated with gout affect the amount of uric acid the body holds onto and releases. Because of genetic factors, gout runs in families. People with a parent, sibling, or other close relative who has gout are more likely to get this condition themselves. It’s likely that genes only set the stage for gout. Environmental factors, such as diet, actually trigger the disease."
562,Gout,Takeaway,Gout can often be successfully treated and managed. Your doctor may prescribe medications that help lower your uric acid levels and reduce inflammation and pain. Your doctor or nutritionist can also recommend changes in your diet to help prevent flare-ups. Balanced eating and healthy lifestyle habits can help you successfully manage gout.
563,Hair Loss,Overview,"It’s typical to lose between 50 and 100 hairs a day, with about 100,000 hairs on your head, making this small loss not noticeable. New hair normally replaces the lost hair, but this doesn’t always happen. Hair loss can be caused by genetics (androgenic alopecia), autoimmune conditions (alopecia areata), or temporary factors like emotional/physical shock, hormonal changes from childbirth or menopause, or certain medications. The sooner you seek treatment for hair loss, the more likely you will be able to reverse or reduce the rate of hair loss. Some causes can’t be reversed, particularly if hair follicles are damaged from tight hairstyles, chemicals, or certain autoimmune diseases. Hair loss (alopecia) is a fairly common occurrence. While it’s more prevalent in older adults, anyone can experience it, including children. It’s typical to lose between50 and 100 hairs a day, according to the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD). With about 100,000 hairs on your head, that small loss isn’t noticeable. New hair normally replaces the lost hair, but this doesn’t always happen. Hair loss can develop gradually over years or happen abruptly. Depending on the underlying cause, it may be temporary or permanent. Trying to tell if you’re actually losing hair or just experiencing some normal shedding? Unsure if it’s time to see a doctor? Read on for more information about hair loss and how to manage it. Sex and gender exist on spectrums. For the purposes of this article, we use “male” and “female” to refer to a person’s sex assigned at birth.Learn more."
564,Hair Loss,Hair loss symptoms,"The main symptom of alopecia is losing more hair than usual, but this can be harder to identify than you might think. The following symptoms can provide some clues: Widening part.If you part your hair, you might start to notice your part getting wider, which can be a sign ofthinning hair. Receding hairline.Similarly, if you notice your hairline looking higher than usual, it may be a sign of thinning hair. Loose hair.Check your brush or comb after using it. Is it collecting more hair than usual? If so, this may be a sign of hair loss. Bald patches.These can range in size and can grow over time. Clogged drains.You might find that your sink or shower drains are clogged with hair. Pain or itching.If you have an underlying skin condition causing your hair loss, you might also feel pain or experience itching on your scalp."
565,Hair Loss,What causes hair loss?,"There are several types of hair loss, some are common and some are rarer, and each with different underlying causes. Depending on the type of hair loss, it can be the result of genetics, internal causes, or external causes. Here’s a look at a few different types of hair loss: Androgenic alopecia refers to hereditary hair loss, likemale pattern baldnessorfemale pattern baldness, and is also known as “pattern alopecia” because it can happen to both males and females. It’s also the most common cause of hair loss, affecting up to50% of people. Hair loss related to androgenic alopecia tends to happen gradually. While some people might experience hair loss as early as puberty, others might not notice symptoms until their middle ages. Female pattern baldness often results in thinning all over the scalp and might look like widening or thinning around the part. It typically occurs after age 65 but, for some females, it can begin early in their lives. Male pattern baldness typically involves progressive hair loss above the temples and thinning at the crown of the head, creating an “M” shape. Learn more about hereditary hair loss. Alopecia areatais an autoimmune condition that causes your immune system to attack hair follicles, resulting in bald patches that can range from small to large. In some cases, it might lead to total hair loss. In addition to losing hair on the scalp, some people with alopecia areata lose hair from their eyebrows, eyelashes, or other parts of the body. Learn more about alopecia areata. Anagen effluvium involves a rapid loss of hair. This usually happens because of radiation treatment or chemotherapy. Hair will usually regrow after the treatment stops. Telogen effluvium is a type of sudden hair loss that results from emotional or physical shock, like a traumatic event, period of extreme stress, or a serious illness. It can also happen because of hormonal changes, like those that happen in: childbirth postpartum menopause Polycystic OvarySyndrome (PCOS) Other potential causes of telogen effluvium include: malnutrition including vitamin or mineral deficiency certain endocrine disorders starting or stopping hormonal birth control post surgery as aresult of the anesthesia acute illnesses or severe infections like COVID-19 Several types of medications can also cause it, including: anticoagulants anticonvulsants oral retinoids beta-blockers thyroid medications This type of hair loss typically resolves on its own once the underlying cause is addressed. Tinea capitis, also called ringworm of the scalp, is a fungal infection that can affect the scalp and hair shaft. It causes small bald patches that are scaly and itchy. Over time, if not treated early, the size of the patch or patches will increase and fill with pus. These patches, sometimes called a kerion,can causescarring as well. Other symptoms include: brittle hair that breaks easily scalp tenderness scaly patches of skin that look grey or red It’s treatable with antifungal medication. Traction alopeciaresults from too much pressure and tension on the hair, often from wearing it in tight styles, like braids, ponytails, or buns."
566,Hair Loss,Photos of hair loss,
567,Hair Loss,How is hair loss diagnosed?,"Because so many things can cause hair loss, it’s best to schedule an appointment with a medical professional if you notice any changes in your hair. They’ll likely use a combination of your health history — including any recent illnesses, surgeries, life stressors, and family history — and a physical exam to help narrow down the causes. If they suspect an autoimmune or skin condition, they might take abiopsyof the skin on your scalp. This involves carefully removing several small sections of skin for laboratory testing. It’s important to keep in mind that hair growth is a complex process and multiple tests may be needed to understand what is causing your hair loss. A biopsy may also be taken if it is initially very unclear what the root causes may be. They may also order blood tests to check for any nutrient deficiencies or signs of an underlying condition."
568,Hair Loss,What are the treatment options for hair loss?,"There’s a range of treatment options for hair loss, but the best option for you will depend on what’s causing your hair loss. Typically, the most common types of hair loss are treated with topical or oral medications, which will likely be the first course of treatment. Over-the-counter (OTC) medications generally consist of topical creams, gels, solutions, or foams that you apply directly to the scalp. The most common products contain an ingredient calledminoxidil. Prescription medications, likefinasteride(Propecia), may help prevent further androgenetic hair loss, especially for male pattern baldness. You take this medication daily to slow hair loss, though some experience new hair growth when taking finasteride. Your clinician might prescribe anti-inflammatory medications, like corticosteroids, if hair loss seems related to an autoimmune condition. Newer treatments that are also being explored include some forms oflaser therapy,microneedling with PRP, as well as other oral medications. Many of these treatments are still in the early testing phases though, and more research will be necessary. Hair transplant surgeryinvolves moving small plugs of skin, each with a few hairs, to bald parts of your scalp. This works well for people with inherited baldness since they typically lose hair on the top of the head. Because some hair loss can be progressive, you may need multiple procedures over time. It is worth noting that this method is unlikely to benefit or help people with scarring alopecias."
569,Hair Loss,How can I prevent hair loss?,"There are a few things you can do to minimize hair loss: Keep hairstyles loose.If you regularly style your hair into braids, buns, or ponytails, try to keep them loose so they don’t put too much pressure on your hair. Avoid touching your hair.As much as possible, try not to pull, twist, or rub your hair. Pat hair dry.After washing, use a towel to gently pat your hair dry. Avoid rubbing your hair with the towel or twisting it within the towel. Aim for a nutrient-rich balanced diet.Try to incorporate plenty ofironandproteininto snacks and meals. Styling products and tools are also common culprits in hair loss. Examples of products or tools that can affect hair loss include: blow dryers heated combs hair straighteners coloring products bleaching agents perms relaxers If you decide to style your hair with heated tools, only do so when your hair is dry and use the lowest settings possible. If you’re currently losing hair, use a gentle baby shampoo to wash your hair. Unless you have extremely oily hair, consider washing your hair only every other day or less."
570,Hair Loss,When to see a doctor about hair loss,"It’s best to see a healthcare professional for any unexplained hair loss so they can determine the underlying cause and best course of treatment. During your appointment, be sure to mention any other unusual symptoms you’ve noticed, including: fatigue unexplained weight loss fever changes in bowel movements rashes or other skin changes on your scalp or body recent surgeries or medical procedures changes to your diet and nutrition any new immunizations or medications Any information you can provide about how quickly the hair loss occurred, along with any family history of baldness, will also be helpful. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
571,Hair Loss,Frequently asked questions about hair loss,"Hair loss is a complicated topic and the role of nutrition in preventing or treating hair loss can be somewhat controversial. While nutrition and specific nutrients are vital to the hair growth process, increasing your intake of these nutrients may not help you, especially if you have a certain type of hair loss, such as scarring alopecia orcicatricial alopecia. Vitamins to incorporate into your nutrition plan thatmay promotehair growth include: B vitamins, specifically riboflavin, biotin, folate, and vitamin B12 iron vitamin C vitamin D Someresearchconnects excess intake of vitamin A or selenium with an increased risks for hair loss. An increased risk of hair lossis connectedwith certain illnesses. These include: polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) scalp psoriasis sexually transmitted infections, such as syphilis thyroid disease Hair loss can also be a side effect of some medications, especially chemotherapy medications to treat cancers. Stopping hair loss indefinitely depends upon the underlying cause. As a general rule, the sooner you treat hair loss, the more likely you will be able to reverse or reduce the rate of hair loss. Some hair losscauses can’t be reversed. This is true for damaged hair follicles from too-tight hairstyles, damaged hair follicles from chemicals applied to the hair, and damages caused by certain autoimmune diseases."
572,Hair Loss,Takeaway,"Whatever the cause of your hair loss, seeking medical attention from your primary care doctor or a dermatologist can help you identify underlying causes. Treatments for hair loss are more likely to be successful if started early. Treatments may include changes to how you care for your hair, improvements to your diet, and medical treatments that may be topically applied or taken in orally. Even if your hair loss is hereditary, there are treatments that exist that can help slow or reverse hair loss. If possible, talk with your doctor to address your concerns and rule out any serious underlying medical concerns that may be causing your hair loss."
573,Headache,Overview,"Headaches can occur as a symptom of another health condition, such as an infection, or as part of a headache disorder. Headache disorders may cause other symptoms, including sensitivity to light or sound and visual changes. Headaches are widespread and felt by almost everyone. Experts estimated that50 to 75 percentof adults had a headache in 2020. Often, headaches are short term and mild, but some can be debilitating and disrupt your daily life. There are several kinds of headaches caused by various factors such as our environment, the medication we take, and other causes. Many treatment options are available to help manage the pain. You can learn more about headaches, includingmigraine headaches, and treatments that can help you live a happier and healthier life."
574,Headache,Common causes of headaches,"Headache disorders are painful, with discomfort felt in the head, neck, and shoulders. A headache occurs because of a primary or secondary cause. Primary headaches, like migraine or tension headaches, are among the most common headaches that lead people to seek medical treatment, and they affect anestimated 3 billion peopleeach year. This type of headache isn‘t a symptom of any disease but a disease on its own. It is a “primary“ headache because it is the main concern. Often, stress and disruptions in your sleep patterns cause these headaches. Secondary headaches manifest as a symptom of another health disorder. Different types of illnesses and disorders can cause a headache, including: infection medication overuse high blood pressure mental health conditions head injuryor trauma stroke tumor nerve disorders sinus congestion"
575,Headache,Types of headaches,"Tension-type headache (TTH)is themost commonprimary headache disorder. TTH may also significantly impact the quality of life for those affected. TTH causes head pain that may occur across both sides and the front and back of theskull. In other words, your entire head may feel pain. People affected by TTH may easily ignore the headache episodes because the pain tends to be mild to moderate, not aggravated by daily physical activity, and doesn‘t cause disability. However, if untreated, TTH may become a chronic (long-term) issue that leads to complications like: sleep disruption jaw muscle and joint disorders anxiety depression Acluster headacheis rare, affectingless than 1 percentof the population. This headache frequently occurs throughout the day. Its symptoms are brief but may be very severe. The pain usually becomesfocusedaround one eye, leading to tearing and redness. In addition, the nose may run or become congested on the same side of the face, and the eyelid may droop. The long-term and excessive use of medication to treat a headache can causemedication-overuse headache (MOH). This condition is considered a secondary headache disorder. MOH is also sometimes described as “rebound headache“ or “medication withdrawal headache.“ MOH commonly occurs with chronic migraine episodes or tension headaches. One of the features of MOH is taking pain medication for at least10 days per monthfor more than 3 months. A2022 reviewindicated MOH as a factor in people who experience disability from chronic migraine, since the medication they take to treat their migraine headaches leads to more headaches. Anew daily persistent headache (NDPH)is a sudden onset headache that doesn‘t stop within 24 hours and reoccurs almost daily. Although not as common as some other headache types, it may cause disabling symptoms and affect your quality of life. Only an estimated0.03 to 0.1 percentof the general population experience NDPH, but its pain is constant with an unknown cause. It typically develops in those with no previous or significant headache history. A type of primary headache, exertional orexercise headachehappens when you participate in strenuous activities or exercise. According to a2020 review, those who receive a diagnosis of exercise headache experience throbbing pain on both sides of the head. There is typically no nausea or vomiting, but the pain may be pulsating. Hemicrania continua is a chronic and persistent headache that always occurs on one side of the face and head. Additionally, people with the condition may experience periods of severe pain instead of the constant pain already felt, making this a debilitating headache. To fit thecriteriafor this headache, you must: have a one-sided daily or continuous headache of moderate intensity experience additional short-lived and piercing head pains feel it for more than 3 months without shifting sides or pain-free periods respond to treatment with the medicationindomethacin Headaches are common inpregnancy. A 2021 review of studies estimated that10 to 17 percentof pregnant people experience primary headaches or migraine. During pregnancy, you may experience stress and significant hormonal changes that lead to headaches. Some medications can be harmful to the mother or fetus. Using medication-free remedies such as an ice pack or taking medications that are safe during pregnancy would be recommended. For example, the doctor may suggestalternative therapiesbefore prescribingmedicationto manage your symptoms."
576,Headache,Migraine headaches,"Migraineis a primary headache disorder that is recurrent and often lifelong. Usually, the pain is intense and throbbing in only one area of the head. Other symptoms of a migraine headache include: nausea vomiting light sensitivity sound sensitivity This type of headache is more common in women by a2-to-1 ratiowhen compared with men, which may be attributed to female hormones. A2018 review of studiessuggests that migraine in females can be influenced by hormone fluctuations, such as those seen in: themenstrual cycle pregnancy menopause the use of oral contraceptives those undergoinghormone replacement therapy The cause of migraine headaches may be a combination of factors, butresearchersbelieve it may also be due to changes in the activity of the brain’s nerve pathways and chemicals. Migraine headaches can be predictable because some start with anaura. An aura is a visual disturbance that can appear as: flashing lights zigzag lines temporary vision loss right before the headache Migraine headaches are sometimes preceded by a prodrome, or “preheadache,“ and some migraine episodes may have an aura before or during the headache. Here are all thestagesof migraine headaches: Premonitory phase.May occur as early as 3 days before a migraine headache, and you can experience symptoms such as fatigue, mood changes, and muscle tenderness. Aura.Approximatelyone-thirdof migraine attacks include an aura, which may last only minutes and develops gradually. Headache.Throbbing pain or other associated symptoms may occur during this stage. Migraine is a type of headache disorder. Some people describe this type of headache as feeling like a migraine attack.Migraineisclassifiedas: a moderate-to-severe headache one-sided pulsating aggravated by routine physical activity lasts hours to 2 to 3 days Migraine attacks can occur anywhere from once a week to once a year. Inchildren, migraine (with or without a headache) can involve: irritability abdominal discomfort fatigue vomiting diarrhea"
577,Headache,Headache and migraine headache triggers,"Migraine and other types of headaches can be triggered by things like diet, activity, and environmental factors. Common triggers include: activityexercisebending overlifting overheadphysical inactivityjet lag exercise bending over lifting overhead physical inactivity jet lag alcoholwinebeerhard liquordrinking too much wine beer hard liquor drinking too much allergy or sinusespollenpollutionseasonalsneezingcongestion pollen pollution seasonal sneezing congestion auditoryloud musicacousticenvironmental noise loud music acoustic environmental noise emotionangeranxietyfearsadnessdepression anger anxiety fear sadness depression food or eatingcaffeinecertain foodsdehydrationsoft drinksnot eating a nutritious dietskipping mealshunger caffeine certain foods dehydration soft drinks not eating a nutritious diet skipping meals hunger hormones medications trauma changes in sleep habits smells stress environment motion from a vehicle visualbright or flashing lightcomputer screenglarefluorescent lightsun exposure bright or flashing light computer screen glare fluorescent light sun exposure"
578,Headache,When to see a doctor,"If you are experiencing headache symptoms three or more times per month, it may be time to see a doctor. Also, consider seeking preventive treatment if the headaches impact your quality of life or cause additional problems like stress, depression, or other concerns. It is also important to talk with your doctor if you are having new headaches or a different type of headache."
579,Headache,Headache testing and diagnosis,"Your doctor may perform a physical exam to diagnose your headache. Otherdiagnostic stepsinclude: Analyzing your medical history.The doctor will ask detailed questions about your headaches, such as when they started, frequency of episodes, pain characteristics, triggers or worsening factors, aura symptoms, and history ofpreventive medications. Comparing your symptoms to the International Classification of Headache Disorders (ICHD-3).Medical professionals use theICHD-3to check criteria and properly diagnose a headache, since there are several types with similar shared symptoms. Determining if an aura is present.If you experience an aura before your headaches, this may be a sign you experience migraine headaches. Asking you to complete a migraine questionnaire.Doctors may ask you to complete a standardized questionnaire about your symptoms and medical history that can give more insight. Potentially requesting medical imaging to rule out other causes.If there is concern that you could be having secondary headaches, the doctor may order imaging tests of the brain, such as aCT or MRI scan, to ensure conditions such as astrokeortumoraren‘t the cause. Performing an eye exam.Since eyestrain can cause headaches, aroutine eye exammay uncover any other vision or eye concerns contributing to your headache, if any. Consider that problems such as swelling due to a brain tumor or inflammation can also cause changes that would be detected during an eye exam. Ordering lab blood tests.To rule out other potential causes for your headache, lab testing of your blood will show your doctor if there are any other concerns, such as infection. Performing a spinal tap.In some cases, brain conditions like inflammation and bleeding may cause headaches. Aspinal tap, also known as a lumbar puncture, involves using a long needle to pull cerebrospinal fluid from your spine to be analyzed."
580,Headache,What is a COVID-19 headache?,"Areview in 2021analyzed headaches and their relationship with COVID-19. It discussed other recent studies estimating the prevalence of the symptom and found that headaches are present in10 to 20 percentof COVID-19 cases. Even though there is still much to learn about the effects of COVID-19, researchers believe the virus may causeinflammationin the brain, leading to a headache. However, more research is needed to be sure."
581,Headache,Headache treatment,"Treatment varies based on the type of headache. A doctor may recommend various treatments for primary headaches. First, they look to treat the underlying cause of the headache. If there is not one,several medicationsare available to manage your symptoms. These include: Acute treatments.Acute treatments are used to help treat a headache and its symptoms after it starts. These include:nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)nasal sprays nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) nasal sprays Preventive treatments.Preventive treatments are taken regularly to help limit how often headaches occur and the severity of symptoms. These can include:antiseizure medicationsantidepressantsinjectable medications, likeEmgalityantipsychotic medicationscalcium channel blockers antiseizure medications antidepressants injectable medications, likeEmgality antipsychotic medications calcium channel blockers Besides medication, there are alternative treatments for headaches as well. For example, noninvasive vagus nerve stimulators are handheld devices that transmit mild electrical stimulation to yourvagus nervethrough the skin. This can help relieve headache pain. Otheralternative treatmentsinclude: heat therapy diet changes acupuncture massage oxygen therapy caffeine When treating a migraine headache disorder, the doctor aims to relieve your symptoms while also preventing migraine attacks. Some common medications for ongoing migraine headaches include: sumatriptan (Imitrex) lasmiditan (Reyvow) ubrogepant (Ubrelvy) Surgical procedures and injections are also options to treat headaches or migraine. Doctors may use these invasive procedures and injections when medications or other alternative treatments are unsuccessful. Theseproceduresinclude: nerve blocks trigger point injections botulinum toxin type A (Botox) Alternative treatmentsto consider for headache or migraine may be: supplements such asmagnesiumand riboflavin (vitamin B2) relaxation training biofeedback cognitive behavioral therapy mindfulnessand meditation hypnosis yoga acupuncture aerobic exercise diet"

583,Headache,Headache prevention,"When thinking about how to prevent your headaches or migraine attacks, it may be best to identify and avoid your triggers. For example, you notice your headaches get a bit worse when you have two cups of coffee instead of one. In this case, you would always try to avoid the second cup and look for alternate ways to get your energy boost. Also, if your headaches are getting worse or seriously impacting your daily life, it may be time to speak with a doctor. They can identify what is causing your headache or the type of headache you have and treat it appropriately. Even though headache disorders are common, you shouldn‘t always ignore them. Instead, it is best to listen to your body and seek help if needed."
584,Hearing Loss,Overview,"Hearing loss may result from conductive hearing loss, sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL), or mixed hearing loss, each with different causes and treatments. Conductive hearing loss involves issues in the outer or middle ear, while SNHL results from damage to the inner ear or nerve pathways. Symptoms of hearing loss may include difficulty hearing, especially in one ear, sudden hearing loss, and ringing in the ear. Headaches or numbness, which may occur in severe cases, warrant prompt medical evaluation. Preventive measures may include using safety equipment in noisy environments, regular hearing tests, avoiding prolonged exposure to loud noises, and seeking prompt treatment for ear infections. Hearing loss typically occurs gradually over time. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) reports that about22%of those between the ages of 65 and 74 experience disabling hearing loss. Other names for hearing loss are: decreased hearing deafness loss of hearing hard of hearing The three main parts of the ear are the outer ear, middle ear, and inner ear. Hearing begins when sound waves pass through the outer ear to the eardrum, which is the thin membrane between your outer and middle ear. When the sound waves reach the eardrum, the eardrum vibrates. The three bones of the middle ear are called the ossicles. These include the hammer, anvil, and stirrup. The eardrum and the ossicles work together to increase the vibrations as the sound waves travel onward to the inner ear. When the sound waves reach the inner ear, they travel through the fluids of the cochlea. The cochlea is a snail-shaped structure in the inner ear. In the cochlea, there are nerve cells with thousands of miniature hairs attached to them. These hairs help convert the sound wave vibrations into electrical signals that then travel to your brain. Your brain interprets these electrical signals as sound. Different sound vibrations create different reactions in these tiny hairs, signaling different sounds to your brain."
585,Hearing Loss,What causes hearing loss?,"TheAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)reports that there are three basic types of hearing loss, each caused by different underlying factors. The three most common causes of decreased hearing are: conductive hearing loss sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) mixed hearing loss Conductive hearing loss occurs when sounds aren’t able to travel from the outer ear to the eardrum and the bones of the middle ear. When this type of hearing loss occurs, you may find it difficult to hear soft or muffled sounds. Conductive hearing loss isn’t always permanent. Medical interventions can treat it. A BAHA (bone-anchored hearing aid) is a surgical medical device sometimes used for conductive hearing loss. Other surgical interventions, such as ear tubes and reconstructive surgery on the ear canal, also help with conductive hearing loss. Conductive hearing loss can be the result of: ear infections allergies swimmer’s ear a buildup of wax in the ear A foreign object that has become stuck in the ear, benign tumors, or scarring of the ear canal due to recurrent infections are all potential causes of hearing loss. SNHL happens when there’s damage to inner ear structures or in the nerve pathways to the brain. This type of hearing loss is usually permanent. SNHL makes even distinct, normal, or loud sounds seem muffled or unclear. SNHL can result from: birth defects that alter the structure of the ear aging working around loud noises trauma to the head or skull Meniere’s disease, a disorder of the inner ear that can affect hearing and balance acoustic neuroma, which is a noncancerous tumor that grows on the nerve that connects the ear to the brain called the “vestibular cochlear nerve” Treatments for sensorineural hearing loss include antibiotics or surgical interventions, such as a cochlear implant. A cochlear implant is a small electrical machine placed under your skin behind the ear. It translates sound vibrations into electrical signals that your brain can then interpret as meaningful sounds. Infections such as the following can also damage the nerves of the ear and lead to SNHL: measles meningitis mumps scarlet fever Some medications, called ototoxic medications, may also cause SNHL. According toASHA, there are over 200 over-the-counter and prescription medications that may cause hearing loss. If you’re taking medications for cancer, heart disease, or a serious infection, talk with your doctor about the hearing risks involved with each. Mixed hearing loss may also occur when conductive hearing loss and SNHL occur at the same time."
586,Hearing Loss,What are the symptoms of hearing loss?,"Hearing loss typically occurs over time. At first, you may not notice any changes in your hearing. However, if you experience any of the following symptoms, you should contact your doctor: hearing loss that interferes with your daily activities hearing loss that becomes worse or that doesn’t go away hearing loss that’s worse in one ear sudden hearing loss ringing in the ear severe hearing loss having ear pain along with hearing problems headaches numbness weakness You should seek emergency medical treatment if you experience headaches, numbness, or weakness along with any of the following: chills quick breathing neck stiffness vomiting sensitivity to light mental agitation These symptoms may occur with life threatening conditions that warrant immediate medical attention, such as meningitis."
587,Hearing Loss,What are the treatment options for hearing loss?,"If you develop hearing loss due to a buildup of wax in the ear canal, you can remove the wax at home. Over-the-counter solutions, including wax softeners, can remove wax from the ear. Syringes can also push warm water through the ear canal to remove the wax. Consult your doctor before attempting to remove any object stuck in your ear to avoid unintentionally damaging your ear. For other causes of hearing loss, you’ll need to see your doctor. If your hearing loss is the result of an infection, your doctor may need to prescribe antibiotics. If your hearing loss is due to other conductive hearing problems, your doctor may refer you to a specialist to receive a hearing aid or a cochlear implant."
588,Hearing Loss,What are the complications associated with hearing loss?,"Hearing loss has been shown to negatively impact people’s quality of life and their mental state. If you develop hearing loss, you may have difficulty understanding others. This can increase your anxiety level or cause depression. Treatment for hearing loss may improve your life significantly. It may restore self-confidence while also improving your ability to communicate with other people."
589,Hearing Loss,How can I prevent hearing loss?,"Not all cases of hearing loss are preventable. However, there are several steps that you can take to protect your hearing: Use safety equipment if you work in areas with loud noises, and wear earplugs when you swim and go to concerts. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders reports that15%of people ages 20 to 69 experienced hearing loss due to loud noise. Get regular hearing tests if you work around loud noises, swim often, or go to concerts regularly. Avoid prolonged exposure to loud noises and music. Seek help for ear infections. They may cause permanent damage to the ear if they’re left untreated."
590,Heart Attack,Overview,"A heart attack happens when blood flow to the heart is blocked. Recognizing symptoms like chest pain, nausea, lightheadedness, and pain that radiates to the neck, jaw, and upper arms is crucial for quick treatment. The primary cause of heart attacks is plaque buildup in the arteries. But risk factors like smoking, high cholesterol, and a sedentary lifestyle can be modified to lower your chances of having a heart attack. If you think you or someone you’re with is having a heart attack, call emergency services immediately. Prompt treatment is essential to restore blood flow and minimize heart damage. Heart attacks are very common in the United States. About805,000heart attacks occur each year, or roughly one every 40 seconds. Chest pain is the most common warning sign of a heart attack. But other symptoms can also occur, like lightheadedness, nausea, and shortness of breath. Symptoms can be severe or mild and often vary from one person to the next. Some people may not even notice any warning signs of a heart attack. This article will take a closer look what causes a heart attack, how to recognize it, what steps to take, and what to expect for treatment."
591,Heart Attack,What is a heart attack?,"A heart attack, also known as amyocardial infarction, occurs when blood flow to the heart is blocked or cut off. If there’s not enough oxygen-rich blood flowing to the heart, it can damage the affected area. As a result, the heart muscle begins to die. When your heart isn’t getting the blood and oxygen it needs to function properly, it can put you at a higher risk ofheart failureand other serious complications. If you, or someone around you, experiences the symptoms of a heart attack, call 911 or your local emergency services immediately. The sooner you can get medical treatment that restores normal blood flow to your heart, the better your chance of a successful outcome."
592,Heart Attack,What are the symptoms of a heart attack?,"General symptoms for a heart attack can include: chest pain or discomfort shortness of breath pain in your arm, shoulder, or neck nausea sweating lightheadednessordizziness fatigue upper body pain trouble breathing Anyone experiencing any of the above heart attack symptoms should contact emergency services immediately. Many people experience a mix of heart attack symptoms regardless of sex or gender. However, there are sex-specific differences in the presentation, biology, and outcomes of heart attacks. A2019 studyfound that chest pain was the most common symptom regardless of sex. According to theAmerican Heart Association (AHA), females are somewhat more likely than men to experience the following heart attack symptoms: shortness of breath nausea or vomiting pain in the upper back or jaw dizziness or lightheadedness extreme fatigue People with diabetes aremore likelyto havesilent heart attackscompared to people who don’t have diabetes. A silent heart attack means you don’t experience symptoms, but there’s still damage to your heart. This may be due tocardiac autonomic neuropathy, a type of nerve damage that’s a common complication ofdiabetes. It may interfere with the ability to feel chest pain caused by a heart attack. Angina is chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart. It’s the pain you feel during a heart attack, but it’s also a symptom of heart disease due to blockages in the arteries that supply blood to your heart. Some people experience frequent and predictable bouts of angina with triggers like exertion. Known as chronicstable angina, this usually eases with rest within about5 minutes. However, angina that’s new or changed may be due to a heart attack. If your chest pain doesn’t subside with rest or lasts longer than usual, you may be having a heart attack. » MORE:How to Tell the Difference Between Angina and a Heart Attack"
593,Heart Attack,What causes a heart attack?,"Theleadingcause of heart attacks iscoronary heart disease. That’s when plaque builds up in the arteries that supply blood to the heart. The general buildup of plaque in the arteries is also known asatherosclerosis. Doctors canclassify heart attacksaccording to the cause: Type 1:The heart attack occurs when a sudden disruption of blood flow occurs due to plaque rupture or a blood clot. Type 2:The lack of oxygen supply to the heart is not due to an event but a systemic issue, like low blood pressure or a fast heart rate. Other causes of heart attacks include: torn blood vessels blood vessel spasms drug misuse hypoxia (lack of oxygen to tissue) orhypoxemia(lack of blood oxygen)"
594,Heart Attack,What are the risk factors for a heart attack?,"Several factorscan put you at greater risk of a heart attack. You can’t change some factors, such asageandfamily history. However, you can make changes related to the following modifiable risk factors: smoking high cholesterol obesity lack of exercise high levels of stress diabetes or prediabetes eating a diet high intrans fatsandsaturated fats excessive alcohol consumption sleep apnea Heart disease is theleading causeof death among most ethnic and racial groups in the United States and the most common cause of heart attacks. People of any age or sex can have a heart attack. However, yourrisk of a heart attackincreases with age. Older adults are most likely to have heart attacks. Males are more likely to have heart attacks earlier in life. Heart disease risk increases in femalesafter menopause. You may be at higher risk of a heart attack if you have a family history of any of the following: heart disease high blood pressure high cholesterol obesity diabetes"
595,Heart Attack,How do doctors diagnose a heart attack?,"Doctors typically diagnose a heart attack after they perform a physical exam and review your medical history. A doctor will likely conduct anelectrocardiogram (ECG)to check your heart’s electrical activity. Your healthcare team will likely also take a blood sample or perform other tests to check for evidence of heart muscle damage. One common test checks for levels oftroponin T, a protein found in the heart muscle. Elevated troponin T levels may suggest a heart attack. Diagnostic imaging can help doctors see how blood is flowing through the heart and detect if any parts have been damaged.Cardiac catheterizationis a test that allows a doctor to visualize blood flow and treat blockages. A doctor may also perform other imaging tests to evaluate the heart,including: echocardiogram CTcoronary angiogram cardiac MRI stress testing"
596,Heart Attack,What is the treatment for a heart attack?,"If you’ve had a heart attack, a doctor may recommend a surgical or nonsurgical procedure. These procedures can relieve pain and help prevent another heart attack from occurring. Common proceduresinclude: Angioplasty:Anangioplastyopens the blocked artery by using a balloon or removing the plaque buildup. Healthcare professionals rarely use angioplasty alone anymore. Stent:A stent is a wire mesh tube surgeons insert into the artery to keep it open after angioplasty. Heart bypass surgery:Inbypass surgery, a doctor reroutes the blood around the blockage. Heart transplant:Surgeons may recommend aheart transplantin cases of serious and irreversible heart failure. A doctor may also prescribemedicationsto treat your heart attack, including: aspirin other drugs tobreak up clots antiplatelet and anticoagulants, also known asblood thinners pain relievers nitroglycerin blood pressure medication beta-blockers cholesterol-lowering medication likestatins Timely treatment of a heart attack is crucial. The sooner you get treatment after having a heart attack, the more quickly blood flow can be restored to the affected part of your heart, and the more successful the outcome is likely to be. Since heart attacks are often unexpected, an emergency room doctor is usually the first healthcare professional to diagnose a heart attack. They may also provide initial medications to break up the blood clot. The emergency doctor will transfer you to acardiologist, a doctor who specializes in treating heart conditions. Cardiologists perform procedures to treat heart attacks and oversee their management and recovery."
597,Heart Attack,How to help someone having a heart attack,"If you are with someone who’s experiencing symptoms of a heart attack, call emergency services immediately and follow the instructions they give you regarding what to do. If the person isn’t responsive and doesn’t have a pulse, doingcardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR)or using anautomated external defibrillator (AED)can be lifesaving. Most businesses and many public places have AEDs, but if one isn’t present, continue to perform CPR until help arrives. Giving CPR can help pump oxygenated blood through a person’s body until emergency services arrive. The sooner a person can get emergency medical attention, the less damage their heart muscle will likely sustain."
598,Heart Attack,What should you do if you have a heart attack?,"If you suspect you’re having a heart attack, theAHAadvises calling 911 or your local emergency services immediately, rather than attempting to drive yourself to the hospital. Paramedics can begin treating you when they arrive and monitor you on the way to the emergency department. Follow the instructions of the emergency personnel on whether to take an aspirin and let them know if you have any medication allergies or bleeding. The antiplatelet qualities of aspirin may help break up the clot that might be blocking blood flow to your heart. If possible, ask a family member, friend, or neighbor to be with you while you wait for the ambulance or are undergoing treatment at the hospital. Because females are more likely to experience atypical heart attack symptoms, they tend to wait longer to contact emergency services, according to a2019 Swiss study. Researchers also found that women tend to experience greater delays in receiving treatment in emergency settings. Recognizing thesymptoms of heart attacks in femalescan make a big difference in getting timely treatment."
599,Heart Attack,What are the possible complications of a heart attack?,"Heart attacks can result in various complications. When a heart attack occurs, it can disrupt your heart’s normal rhythm, potentially stopping it altogether. These abnormal rhythms are known asarrhythmiasand can cause sudden cardiac death. When your heart stops getting a supply of blood during a heart attack, some of the heart tissue can die. This can weaken your heart and cause serious complications such asheart failure. Heart attacks can also affect your heart valves and cause leaks. The long-term effects on your heart will depend on how long it takes to receive medical treatment and how much damage your heart sustains."
600,Heart Attack,What to expect during recovery after a heart attack,"A heart attack can damage your heart muscles and affect their function. This can include changing your heart’s rhythm and reducing its ability to pump blood effectively to all the organs and tissues in your body. Following a heart attack, it’s essential to work with your healthcare team to design arecovery plan. This plan may include the following lifestyle changes: participating in light or moderate exercise, according to what your doctor approves eating a nutrient-dense,balanced dietlow in saturated and trans fats losing weightif you’re carrying extra weight quitting smokingif you smoke monitoring your blood sugar levelsclosely if you have diabetes taking steps to keep yourblood pressureandcholesterolwithin a healthy range avoiding strenuous activities, especially shortly after the heart attack undergoingcardiac rehabilitation"
601,Heart Attack,How to prevent a heart attack,"While some risk factors are beyond your control, you can take some basic steps to help keep your heart healthy. Examplesinclude: Eat a healthy, balanced diet:Try to incorporateheart-healthy foods, like lean proteins, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and low fat dairy, as often as possible. Limit fatty, fried foods and foods that contain simple sugars like sodas, baked goods, and white bread. Exercise regularly:Aim for at least150 minutesof physical activity a week for optimum heart health. Quit smoking:If you smoke, consider talking with a doctor about starting asmoking cessation program. Limit your alcohol intake:Moderation is key when it comes to alcohol and heart health. If you do drink, limit yourself toone drink per dayfor women or two drinks per day for men. Get your cholesterol levels checked:If yourLDL cholesterolortriglyceridesare higher than they should be, talk with a doctor about what you need to do to lower them. Manage diabetes:If you have diabetes, take your medications as prescribed and check your blood glucose levels regularly. Work with a doctor:If you have a heart condition, work closely with a doctor and follow your treatment plan, which includes taking your medications."
602,Heart Attack,The bottom line,"Most people who have a heart attack survive. Still, it’s important to know how to reduce your risk and how to respond if you experience symptoms of a heart attack. While chest pain is the most common symptom, it’s only one of several common signs of a heart attack. If you think you may be having a heart attack, call for emergency medical help immediately. The sooner you get treatment for a heart attack, the better the outcome will likely be. Doctors can use various tests to diagnose a heart attack and guide treatment. Effective treatment plans help restore blood flow and minimize complications. If you have any risk factors for a heart attack, talk with a doctor about steps you can take to lower your risk."
603,Heart Disease,Overview,"Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States. It can’t be cured or reversed, but medications, procedures, and lifestyle changes can relieve many symptoms. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 1 in 5 deaths resulted from heart disease in 2021 in the United States. That’s about 695,000people."
604,Heart Disease,Who gets heart disease?,"Heart disease doesn’t discriminate. It’s the leading cause of death for several populations, including white people, Hispanic people, and Black people. Almost half of people in the United States are at risk of heart disease, and thenumbers are rising. While it can be deadly, it’s also preventable in most people. By adopting certain lifestyle habits early, you can potentially live longer with a healthier heart."
605,Heart Disease,What are the different types of heart disease?,Heart disease encompasses a wide range of cardiovascular problems. Several diseases and conditions fall under the umbrella of heart disease. Types of heart disease include: arrhythmia atherosclerosis cardiomyopathy congenital heart defects coronary artery disease (CAD) heart infections The term “cardiovascular disease” may also refer to heart conditions that specifically affect the blood vessels.
606,Heart Disease,What are the symptoms of heart disease?,"Different types of heart disease can cause a variety of symptoms. Arrhythmia is an abnormal heart rhythm. The symptoms you experience may depend on the type of arrhythmia you have, such as a heart rate that’stoo fastortoo slow. Learn more about thesymptoms of arrhythmia. Atherosclerosis reduces blood supply to your extremities. In addition tochest painandshortness of breath, symptoms of atherosclerosis include fatigue and muscle weakness in the legs from poor circulation. Learn more about thesymptoms of atherosclerosis. Congenital heart defects are heart problems that develop when a fetus is growing. Some heart defects are never diagnosed. Others may be detected when they cause symptoms. Learn more about thesymptoms of congenital heart defects. CAD is plaque buildup in the arteries that move oxygen-rich blood through the heart and lungs. Learn more about thesymptoms of CAD. Cardiomyopathy is a disease that causes the heart muscles to grow larger and turn rigid, thick, or weak. Learn more about the symptoms ofcardiomyopathy. Heart infections include the conditionsendocarditisandmyocarditis. Read more about thesigns and symptoms of heart disease."
607,Heart Disease,What are the symptoms of heart disease in women?,"Females often experience different signs and symptoms of heart disease than males, specifically CAD and other cardiovascular diseases. A2016 studylooked at the symptoms most often seen in women who had experienced a heart attack. The top symptoms didn’t include the “classic” heart attack symptoms, such as chest pain and tingling. Instead, researchers reported that women were more likely to experienceanxiety, indigestion, and fatigue. Symptoms of heart disease in females can also be confused with other conditions, such asdepression,menopause, and anxiety. Learn more about thecommon signs and symptoms of heart attack in men and women."
608,Heart Disease,What causes heart disease?,"Heart disease is a collection of diseases and conditions that cause cardiovascular problems. Each type of heart disease is caused by something entirely unique to that condition. Thecauses of an abnormal heart rhythminclude: diabetes CAD heart defects high blood pressure(hypertension) certain medications This heart disease occurs while a baby is still developing in the uterus. Some heart defects may be serious and diagnosed and treated early. Some may also go undiagnosed for many years. Yourheart’s structurecan also change as you age. This can create a heart defect that may lead to complications and problems. There are several types of cardiomyopathy. Each type is the result of a separate condition: dilated cardiomyopathy(themost commontype) hypertrophic cardiomyopathy restrictive cardiomyopathy The causes range from other medical conditions orcomorbiditiesor genetics. Not all the causes are fully understood. Bacteria, parasites, and viruses are the most common causes of heart infections. Uncontrolled infections in the body can also harm the heart if they’re not properly treated."
609,Heart Disease,What are some risk factors for heart disease?,"There are many risk factors for heart disease. Some are controllable and others aren’t. According to the CDC,around 47%of people in the United States have at least one risk factor for heart disease. Some of these risk factors include: high blood pressure high cholesteroland low levels ofhigh-density lipoprotein (HDL), the “good” cholesterol smoking obesity low physical activity Smoking, for example, is a controllable risk factor. People who smoke double their chance of developing heart disease, according to theNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. People with diabetes may also have a higher risk of heart disease because highblood glucose levelsincrease the chance of: angina heart attack stroke CAD If you have diabetes, managing your glucose can limit your chance of developing heart disease. People with both high blood pressure and diabetes have ahigher riskof cardiovascular disease. Other risk factors for heart disease include: family history ethnicity sex age Although these risk factors aren’t controllable, you may be able to monitor their effects. A family history of CAD is especially concerning ifit involves: a male relative under 55 years old a female relative under 65 years old Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic white people, and people of Asian or Pacific Islander heritage have a higher risk than Native Alaskan or Native American people. Also, males have a greater risk of heart disease than females. According to theCDC, the prevalence of heart disease is higher in men than in women. Learn more about the risk factors for CAD."
610,Heart Disease,How is heart disease diagnosed?,"Your doctor may order several types of tests and evaluations to make a heart disease diagnosis. Some of these tests can be performed before you ever have symptoms of heart disease. Other tests may be used to look for possible causes of symptoms when they develop. The first thing your doctor will do is perform aphysical exam. They will take an account of the symptoms you’ve been experiencing. Then they will want to know yourfamilyand personal medical history. Genetics can play a role in some heart diseases. If you have a close family member with heart disease, share this information with your doctor. Blood tests are frequently ordered. This is because they can help your doctor see yourcholesterol levelsand look for signs of inflammation. A variety of noninvasive tests may be used to diagnose heart disease, such as: electrocardiogram (EKG) echocardiogram stress test carotid ultrasound Holter monitor tilt-table test CT scan heart MRI If a physical exam, blood tests, and noninvasive tests aren’t conclusive, your doctor may want to look inside your body to determine what’s causing your symptoms. Invasive tests may include: cardiac catheterization coronary angiography electrophysiology Read more about thetests used to diagnose heart disease."
611,Heart Disease,What treatments are available for heart disease?,"Treatment for heart disease largely depends on the type of heart disease you have as well as how far it has advanced. For example, if you have a heart infection, your doctor is likely to prescribe an antibiotic. If you have plaque buildup, your doctor may take a two-pronged approach: prescribe a medication that can help lower your risk of additional plaque buildup and look to help you adopt certain lifestyle strategies. Treatment for heart disease falls into three main categories: Some lifestyle strategies can help protect your heart. These include: eating a heart-healthy diet, such as theDASH diet gettingregular exercise quitting smoking limitingalcohol consumption A medication may be necessary to treat certain types of heart disease. Your doctor can prescribe a medication that can either cure or manage your heart disease. Your doctor may also prescribe medications that slow or stop the risk of complications. The exact drug you’re prescribed depends on the type of heart disease you have. Examples include: beta-blockers blood thinners calcium channel blockers ACE inhibitors Read more about thedrugs that treat heart disease. In some cases of heart disease,surgeryor a medical procedure is necessary to treat the condition and prevent worsening symptoms. For example, if you havearteries that are blockedentirely or almost completely by plaque buildup, your doctor may insert astentin your artery to return regular blood flow. The procedure your doctor performs depends on the type of heart disease you have and the extent of damage to your heart."
612,Heart Disease,How can I prevent heart disease?,"Some risk factors of heart disease can’t be controlled, like your family history. But it’s still important to lower your chance of developing heart disease by decreasing the risk factors you can control. Having healthy blood pressure and cholesterol ranges are some of the first steps you can take for a healthy heart. Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mm Hg). A healthy blood pressure is consideredless than 120 systolic and 80 diastolic, which is often expressed as “120 over 80” or “120/80 mm Hg.” Systolic is the measurement of pressure while the heart is contracting. Diastolic is the measurement when the heart is resting. Higher numbers indicate that the heart is working too hard to pump blood. Your ideal cholesterol level depends on your risk factors and heart health history. If you have a high risk of heart disease, havediabetes, or have already had aheart attack, your target levels will be below those of people with low or average risk. Practicing the same lifestyle strategies that can help you manage heart disease can also help reduce your chance of developing it. Doctors recommend30–60 minutes of exerciseon most days for a total of 2 hours and 30 minutes each week. Check with your doctor to make sure you can safely meet these guidelines, especially if you already have a heart condition. Quitting smoking can help your heart health because nicotine in cigarettes causes blood vessels to constrict, making it harder for oxygenated blood to circulate. This can lead to atherosclerosis. In addition,managing your stresscan help lower your chance for heart disease becausechronic stresscancontributeto the development of heart problems. Making these changes all at once might not be possible, and that’s OK. Talk with your doctor about what will have the biggest impact right now. Even small steps toward these goals help keep you at your healthiest. Learn about ways toreduce the chance of heart disease."
613,Heart Disease,Frequently asked questions,"High blood pressure (hypertension) makes the heart work harder to circulate blood. This can result in a thickened heart muscle and narrowed arteries. High blood pressure also makes your heart muscles thicker and less elastic, impairing its ability to pump blood. This reduces the circulation of the oxygen-rich blood your body needs. Read more about hypertensive heart disease. It’s not possible to cure or reverse heart disease, so it requires lifetime treatment and monitoring. But medications, procedures, and lifestyle strategies can relieve symptoms. Coronary intervention orbypass surgerymight be used if other methods aren’t effective. Sinus bradycardiais an abnormally slow heart rate. It’s not necessarily a cause for concern on its own. In fact, it’s often a marker of a healthy heart in athletes or people who are young. But in some cases, itcan causeserious heart problems. If you have a leaky heart valve, walking regularly can be good exercise for your heart. Do your bestto walk at a pace in which you are breathing hard and fast but can still carry on a conversation. You can also do other aerobic exercises, such as swimming or cycling, following the same principle. Beta-blockers slow and reduce the strength of your heartbeat. They also decrease your blood pressure. They work by blocking the hormoneadrenaline(epinephrine) from binding to beta receptors in your body."
614,Heart Disease,Takeaway,"Almost half of all people in the United States have an elevated chance of developing heart disease, and the numbers continue to rise. However, adopting heart-healthy lifestyle strategies can prevent or manage many cases of heart disease. It’snot always easyto make these lifestyle changes in our busy and fast-paced lives, but there arehuge benefits. If you take care of your heart now, it’s more likely to take care of you later in life."
615,Heart Failure,Overview,"Heart failure occurs when your heart can’t pump enough blood to the body, requiring ongoing treatment to maintain proper bodily functions. Approximately 6.2 million people in the United States have heart failure. The types of heart failure include right-sided and left-sided, each affecting different ventricles and leading to fluid retention and congestion. Left sided heart failure has two subtypes: systolic and diastolic. Heart failure is typically a chronic condition needing continuous management to prevent complications and improve quality of life. Early treatment is crucial to preventing severe heart failure. Approximately6.2 millionpeople have heart failure in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Heart failure often happens when there is a problem with the ventricles, which are two chambers located in the lower part of your heart. They’re responsible forpumping bloodout of your heart. Heart failure can be classified by the side of the heart that’s affected (left or right). Both sides are often affected. Congestive heart failure (CHF) is sometimes used synonymously with heart failure since the symptoms of both right- and left-sided heart failure include congestion. In right-sided heart failure, there is congestion with fluid buildup in the abdomen and lower extremities. In left-sided heart failure, fluid builds up in the lungs. Heart failure is a serious health condition that requires immediate medical treatment. Early treatment decreases your risk of complications over time. A heart attack is a problem caused by blocked coronary arteries that feed the heart. Heart failure is a muscle problem. If you experience sudden, severe, and sharp chest pain, call 911 or your local emergency services right away. It may be a sign of a heart attack. Other symptoms of a heart attack may include: shortness of breath pain in your left arm, shoulder, or neck nausea or sweating lightheadedness or dizziness fatigue A heart attack may lead to heart failure if it causes a significant amount of heart muscle damage."
616,Heart Failure,What are the symptoms of heart failure?,"The most common symptoms of heart failureinclude: Shortness of breath:This is more common during activities. However, it may occur when you’re resting or come on suddenly at night. Fatigue:You may feel tired all the time, especially during daily activities like walking, shopping, or getting up. Edema (swelling):You may experience a fluid buildup in your body, especially in the legs, feet, and ankles. Feeling faint, weak, or lightheaded:Because the heart cannot pump enough blood to all your body’s tissues, it prioritizes blood supply to your heart and brain, which can leave your body feeling tired. Other symptoms of heart failure mayinclude: sudden weight gain a loss of appetite bloating confusion, memory loss, or impaired thinking persistent coughing heart palpitations abdominal swelling protruding neck veins Heart failure is a chronic condition. This type of condition requires ongoing, lifelong management. However, you may experienceacute heart failure, which is when symptoms come on suddenly. This is sometimes referred to as heart failure exacerbation or flares. It may happen as an initial symptom when heart failure is diagnosed for the first time. Or, it may happen on top of chronic heart failure when your symptoms worsen."
617,Heart Failure,What are the types of heart failure?,"Since heart failure may affect either side of the heart, the types of heart failure are right-sided heart failure and left-sided heart failure. Both types lead to the activation of hormones and the nervous system, which causes the body to retain fluid, leading to symptoms of congestion. Left-sided heart failure occurs when the left ventricle in the bottom left of your heart doesn’t pump blood out efficiently. Heart failure in this ventricle prevents your body from getting enough oxygen-rich blood. There aretwo typesof left-sided heart failure: Systolic:This occurs when the heart muscle weakens and loses its ability to contract. A weaker left ventricle cannot generate enough force to pump oxygen-rich blood through the body. This may cause blood to back up into your lungs, leading to fluid buildup. This is known as congestive heart failure. Diastolic:This occurs when the heart muscle stiffens and impairs the heart’s ability to relax. It prevents your heart from filling with enough oxygenated blood, resulting in less efficient blood flow to the body. Systolic heart failure ismore commonin males. Diastolic heart failure is more common in females. The right ventricle is located in the bottom right side of your heart. It’s responsible for pumping blood to your lungs to collect oxygen. Left-sided heart failure usually triggers right-sided heart failure. The accumulation of blood in the lungs makes the right ventricle work harder. This can stress the right side of the heart and cause it to fail."
618,Heart Failure,What causes heart failure?,"Heart failure happens when your heart muscle gets weak or stiff. This may then block or reduce blood flow to the heart. The most common cause of heart failure is coronary artery disease (CAD). It happens when fatty depositsbuild up in your arteries, reducing the supply of blood and oxygen to the heart. Other conditions that may increase your risk of developing heart failure include: heart attack inherited heart disease a condition that weakens the heart muscle, like cardiomyopathy heart inflammation, like myocarditis high blood pressure, also called hypertension arrhythmia, which is an irregular heart rhythm viral infection congenital heart disease diabetes obesity pressure in your lungs, called pulmonary hypertension overactive thyroid, also known as hyperthyroidism Certain behaviors may also increase your risk of developing heart failure, including: smoking drinking alcohol eating foods high in fat or cholesterol not getting enough physical activity"
619,Heart Failure,How is heart failure diagnosis?,A will doctor start by performing a physical exam and assessing your medical history to check for signs of heart failure. They may also use an echocardiogram. This test is the most effective way to diagnose heart failure. It uses sound waves to create detailed pictures of your heart. An echocardiogram can help a doctor evaluate the damage to your heart and how it’s functioning. Other tests to help diagnose heart failure or its underlying causes include: chest X-ray heart MRI nuclear scan cardiac catheterization coronary angiogram stress test Holter monitoring BNP blood test
620,Heart Failure,How is heart failure treated?,"Treating heart failure depends on the severity of your condition and the type of heart failure you have. Early treatment can improve symptoms fairly quickly. However, you should still get regular testing and follow up with a healthcare professional at least every6 months. The main goal of treatment is to increase your life span, prevent complications, and improve your quality of life. Medications may treat early stages of heart failure. They can help relieve your symptoms and prevent your condition from worsening. Certain medications are prescribed to: improve your heart’s ability to pump blood reduce blood clots reduce your heart rate when necessary remove excess sodium and replenish potassium levels reduce cholesterol levels reduce adverse hormones and reactions that occur in your body that can make the heart weaker These medications can include: angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) angiotensin receptor-neprilysin inhibitors (ARNIs) beta-blockers mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors nitrates hydralazine ivabradine Verquvo (vericiguat) cholesterol-lowering medications blood thinners Speak with a doctor before taking new medications. People with heart failure should avoid some medications, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) like naproxen (Aleve, Naprosyn) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin). These can worsen fluid retention in heart failure. You may require surgery if you have heart failure. Options include: Bypass surgery:A surgeon takes a healthy piece of an artery or vein and attaches it to the blocked coronary artery. This allows the blood to bypass the blocked, damaged artery and flow through the new one. Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI):A catheter with a small balloon attached to it is inserted into the blocked or narrowed artery. When it reaches the damaged artery, a surgeon inflates the balloon to open the artery. Transplant surgery:Heart transplants are used in the final stages of heart failure when all other treatments have not worked. A surgeon removes all or part of your heart and replaces it with a heart from a donor. You may require surgery to implant a device to help monitor your heart rhythm. These small devices are placed into the chest to help control heart rhythms. They may slow your heart rate when the heart is beating too quickly or increase your heart rate if it’s beating too slowly. Biventricular pacemakers are sometimes used forcardiac resynchronization therapy. These may help your heart chambers pump in sync. AnLVADhelps your left ventricle pump blood out to the rest of your body. This battery-powered device keeps track of your heart rate. It shocks your heart if it detects an abnormal heart rhythm. This restores the heart rate to a normal rhythm. Doctors suggest an ICD for people with an ejection fraction of less than30–35%. An ejection fraction refers to how much blood your heart pumps out of the left ventricle with each contraction. A normal range is55–70%."
621,Heart Failure,Can you prevent heart failure?,Some lifestyle measures can help treat heart failure and prevent the condition from developing. These mayinclude: getting regular physical activity maintaining a moderate weight limiting alcohol intake eating a well-balanced diet not smoking getting the right amount of sleep
622,Heart Failure,What are the complications of heart failure?,"Untreated heart failure can eventually lead to CHF, which could be life threatening. This is when blood builds up in other areas of your body. You may experience fluid retention in your limbs and organs, such as the liver and lungs. Additional complications of heart failureinclude: stroke kidney dysfunction liver dysfunction thromboembolism arrhythmias, like ventricular arrhythmias heart attack"
623,Heart Failure,Frequently asked questions,"Yes, and early diagnosis gives your doctor more time to find the best treatment for you and gives you time to treat the condition before it becomes critical. Early diagnosis involves recognizing the sometimes subtle signs and the main symptoms of heart failure: shortness of breath fatigue edema (swelling) feeling faint, weak, or lightheaded Other signs and symptoms may include: sudden weight gain loss of appetite bloating persistent coughing heart palpitations abdominal swelling confusion, memory loss, or impaired thinking Yes. A B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) blood test measures the levels of a hormone called the BNP hormone in your blood. BNP helps keep your veins and arteries dilated and has a role in keeping salt and fluid balance in the body. If you have heart failure, your heart produces more BNP, and it’s visible on a BNP blood test. Congestive heart failure is diagnosed using a combination of history and physical examination, blood testing, and imaging tests. Imaging tests provide details about the type and cause of heart failure. An echocardiogram is performed to look at the heart’s structure and function. This test uses sound waves to produce pictures of the heart. Cardiologists can look at the heart’s structure, including heart muscle, chambers, and valves, along with the heart’s pumping and filling. Other tests that cardiologists may use to investigate heart failure include stress echocardiogram, nuclear imaging, cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and cardiac computed tomography (CT). Heart failure may not cause obvious signs or symptoms initially. Some people may have vague or quiet signs and symptoms that come on slowly, making it hard to recognize a problem. Some of these subtle signs include: edema fatigue reduced stamina shortness of breath cough If you notice these, contact a doctor for a checkup. Thefour stagesof heart failure are A, B, C, and D. These refer to the severity of symptoms and how your heart is functioning as your condition progresses: Stage A:You have no symptoms but may be at risk of heart failure. Stage B: You have atypical changes in your heart’s structure or function but no symptoms of heart failure. Stage C:You have symptoms of heart failure. Stage D:Your symptoms of heart failure affect your daily life and may require repeated hospital admissions. The authors of a2019 reviewof studies found that approximately 60% of people were alive 5 years after their chronic heart failure diagnosis. After 10 years, approximately 1 in 3 people were still alive. Survival rates are just estimates. Your outlook depends on several factors, such as age, lifestyle habits, other medical conditions, and stage at diagnosis. The most common signs of heart failure include: fatigue edema (swelling) shortness of breath exercise intolerance For someone with heart failure, any progression of symptoms is serious. Contact your cardiologist if you notice worsening symptoms. Some particularly concerning symptoms include: worsening shortness of breath chest discomfort lightheadedness and dizziness Congestive heart failure (CHF) is another term used for heart failure. It emphasizes the congestion that occurs due to a backup of blood flow, which causes fluid retention, swelling, and pulmonary edema (fluid in the lungs)."
624,Heart Failure,Takeaway,Heart failure happens when your heart is unable to pump enough blood throughout your body. It’s typically a chronic condition that requires ongoing treatment to prevent complications and increase your quality of life. Your outlook and treatment of heart failure varies depending on the type of heart failure you have. Early treatment is key in preventing the most serious cases of heart failure.
625,Heartburn,Overview,"Heartburn is commonly caused by stomach acid flowing back into the esophagus, often due to a malfunctioning lower esophageal sphincter. Risk factors include hiatal hernias, pregnancy, smoking, obesity, and certain medications. Lifestyle adjustments like avoiding trigger foods, wearing loose clothing, and waiting a few hours after eating before lying down can help manage occasional heartburn. Over-the-counter medications such as antacids, H2 blockers, and PPIs can help relieve heartburn, but should not be used long-term without consulting a doctor due to potential side effects. Heartburnis a burning sensation in your chest, behind your breastbone. It occurs when stomach acid travels back up your esophagus — the tube that carries food from your mouth to your stomach. In general, you can manage your heartburn symptoms at home. If frequent heartburn makes it difficult to eat or swallow, however, it’s a good idea to speak with your doctor. Read on to learn more about heartburn."
626,Heartburn,What are the symptoms of heartburn?,"Heartburn symptomscan rangefrom mild discomfort to extremely uncomfortable. The most common symptom is a burning feeling in your chest and throat. Heartburn feels like an uncomfortable or burning pain in the middle of your chest. You may also experience: a burning sensation in your throat pressure or pain behind your breastbone difficulty swallowing worsening pain after lying down or bending over an acidic, sour, or bitter taste in your mouth coughing or hoarseness In general, heartburn symptoms begin shortly after eating andcan lastanywhere from a few minutes to a couple of hours. How long you experience symptoms depends on the underlying cause. It also depends on what you do at the first sign of symptoms. For example, sometimes heartburn symptoms last until your body digests the triggering food. Other times, it goes away if you stand up instead of lying down after eating. If you takeover-the-counter (OTC) antacidsor prescription medications as part of a treatment plan, your symptomsmight not lastas long."
627,Heartburn,What causes heartburn?,"Heartburn typically occurs when contents from the stomach back up into theesophagus, a tube that carries food and fluids from the mouth to the stomach. Your esophagus connects to your stomach at a juncture known as the lower esophageal sphincter. If the lower esophageal sphincter is functioning properly, it closes when food leaves the esophagus and enters the stomach. However, in some people, thelower esophageal sphincterdoesn’t function properly. This allows the stomach contents to leak back into the esophagus., which can cause heartburn. Certain conditions and other factors may make it more likely for you to experience heartburn. Risk factors include: Hiatal hernia:Ahiatal herniaoccurs when the upper part of your stomach penetrates through the diaphragm, usually by way of a weakness or tear. Pregnancy:Heartburn iscommon during pregnancy, especially during the third trimester. Smoking:Smokingis associatedwith an increased chance of developing gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). According to a2018 review, people who quit or decreased tobacco smoking were three times more likely to have a reduction in their heartburn symptoms. Overweight or obesity:Obesity is a contributing risk factor to GERD.Researchhas shown that in people with obesity, weight loss can reduce GERD symptoms. Medications:Some medications, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, sedatives, and blood pressure medications,can increaseyour risk of heartburn. If you have heartburn, you may find that certainfoodsand drinks can trigger your symptoms. Thesemay include: carbonated drinks chocolate citrus fruits tomatoes and tomato-based products peppermint fried foods high fat foods spicy foods alcohol Other triggers that can contribute to heartburn include: eating a large meal lying down immediately after eating wearing tight clothes"
628,Heartburn,Lifestyle changes for heartburn,"If you experience occasional heartburn, a combination of lifestyle changes and medications can help alleviate your symptoms. Lifestyle changescan also help reduce your symptoms. You might want to try: avoiding foods that trigger your symptoms wearing loose clothing avoiding lying down right after eating speaking with a healthcare professional about a smoking cessation program and other supportive resources, if applicable"
629,Heartburn,Treatment options for heartburn,"You can use OTC medications to reduce discomfort. TheFDAidentifies three classes of OTC medications for treating occasional heartburn. These include: Antacids:These medications help neutralize stomach acid and can provide quick relief from your symptoms. Some options include:MylantaRolaidsTumsAlka-SeltzerGaviscon Mylanta Rolaids Tums Alka-Seltzer Gaviscon Histamine-2 (H2) blockers:These reduce the amount of acid your stomach makes. Examples include:cimetidine (Tagamet HB)famotidine (Pepcid Complete or Pepcid AC)nizatidine (Axid AR) cimetidine (Tagamet HB) famotidine (Pepcid Complete or Pepcid AC) nizatidine (Axid AR) Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs):These medications reduce the amount of acid in your stomach and can help heal damaged tissue in your esophagus. However, they shouldn’t be taken long term. Options include:lansoprazole (Prevacid 24 HR)esomeprazole (Nexium 24 HR)omeprazole magnesium (Prilosec)omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid) lansoprazole (Prevacid 24 HR) esomeprazole (Nexium 24 HR) omeprazole magnesium (Prilosec) omeprazole and sodium bicarbonate (Zegerid) Although medication can help, they also come withside effects. Antacids can cause constipation or diarrhea, and PPIs can cause headaches, diarrhea, and an upset stomach. Speak with your doctor about any medications you’re already taking to see if you’re at risk for any drug interactions. If OTC medications do not relieve your symptoms, your doctor may be able to prescribe stronger versions of these medications. Antacids help neutralize the acid your stomach makes. They provide fast, short-term relief from heartburn symptoms. While they’re useful in a pinch, they are not intended for daily use. You should takeantacidsshortly after eating or when you experience symptoms. Antacids come in liquid, tablet, or gummy form. Most contain one or more of the following ingredients: calcium aluminum magnesium Be sure to follow the directions on the label and avoid overusing antacids. Speak with your doctor if you have any questions about using an antacid or experience any complications after taking one."
630,Heartburn,How can I prevent heartburn?,"There are many steps you can take to help prevent heartburn. You might want to try: Avoiding foods or drinks that may trigger your symptoms, such as acidic foods, high fat foods, spicy foods, chocolate, alcohol, mint, and carbonated drinks. Waiting a few hours after eating to lie down. Placing blocks or books under your bed toelevate the head of your bed. Avoiding tight-fitting clothes. Eating smaller, more frequent meals rather than two or three large ones. Stopping smoking, if applicable. Maintaining a moderate weight."
631,Heartburn,When should I see my doctor about heartburn?,"Heartburn is common, and many people experience it from time to time. However, you should contact your doctor if you experience heartburn more than twice per week or if you have heartburn that does not improve with treatment. Contact your doctor if you have heartburn and develop: difficulty swallowing pain with swallowing dark, tarry, or bloody stools shortness of breath pain that radiates from your back to your shoulder dizziness lightheadedness sweating while having chest pain Some people who have heartburn can think they’re having a heart attack because the symptoms can be very similar. Symptoms of a heart attackinclude: severe or crushing chest pain or discomfort difficulty breathing feeling weak, lightheaded, or faint jaw pain arm pain If you or someone else are experiencing heart attack symptoms, like a burning sensation in the chest, seek immediate medical attention."
632,Heartburn,How is heartburn diagnosed?,"A doctor generally diagnoses heartburn based on your symptoms and medical history. During the appointment when you’re diagnosed, your doctor can recommend a treatment plan. You may need to see your healthcare professional again if lifestyle changes, OTC medication, or prescription medications don’t improve your symptoms. This may be a sign that you have a more serious condition called GERD. To diagnose GERD, your doctor will review your medical history and ask you about your symptoms. They may also order several tests, including: Ambulatory acid (pH) probe test:Your doctor will pass a small tube through your nose into your esophagus. A sensor at the tip of the tube measures the amount of stomach acid in your esophagus. Esophageal pH monitoring:Your doctor will place a capsule on the lining of your esophagus to measure acid reflux. X-ray:You’ll drink a chalky liquid that coats your upper digestive tract. Your doctor will then use X-ray imaging to look at your esophagus, stomach, and upper intestine. Endoscopy:Your doctor will pass a small tube equipped with a camera down your throat into your stomach to check for an ulcer of the esophagus or stomach lining. Esophageal manometry:Your doctor will place a tube through your nose into your esophagus to measure the contractions of your esophagus when you swallow. Depending on your diagnosis, your doctor will be able to provide you with treatment options to help reduce or eliminate your symptoms."
633,Heartburn,What are the complications associated with heartburn?,"Occasional heartburn usually isn’t a cause for concern. However, frequent heartburn may be a symptom of GERD, a more serious condition that means you might need prescription medication or surgery. If left untreated, GERD may lead to additional health problems, such as an inflammation of the esophagus. This is called esophagitis, or Barrett’s esophagus. It causes changes in the lining of the esophagus that can increase your risk of esophageal cancer. Long-term heartburncan also affect your quality of life. If you find it difficult to carry on your daily life or are severely limited in your activities due to heartburn, it’s a good idea to speak with your doctor."
634,Heartburn,The bottom line,"Heartburn is a relatively common condition, and most people experience it from time to time. You can manage heartburn symptoms at home with lifestyle changes, home remedies, and OTC medications. However, if you have frequent or persistent heartburn, you might want to contact your doctor."
635,Hemmorrhoids,Overview,"Hemorrhoids happen when the veins around your anus become swollen, often due to straining during a bowel movement or constipation. Certain types of hemorrhoids may cause severe pain."
636,Hemmorrhoids,What are hemorrhoids?,"Hemorrhoids are swollen veins located around the anus or in the lowerrectum. About50 percentof adults experience the symptoms of hemorrhoids by the age of 50. Hemorrhoids can either be internal or external. Internal hemorrhoids develop within the anus or rectum. External hemorrhoids develop outside of the anus. Hemorrhoids are also known as piles. External hemorrhoids are the most common and most troublesome. Hemorrhoids may cause pain, severeitching, and difficulty sitting. Fortunately, they’re treatable."
637,Hemmorrhoids,What are the symptoms of hemorrhoids?,"Symptoms depend on the type of hemorrhoids you have. Internal hemorrhoids can cause: blood on the tissueafter having a bowel movement skin that sticks out of the anus during bowel movements External hemorrhoid symptoms include: extreme itching around the anus uncomfortable lump(s) or swelling near your anus aches or pain around the anus, especially when sitting Hemorrhoids often don’t cause pain. However, sometimes external hemorrhoids can form a blood clot on the skin. This is known as athrombosed hemorrhoid. Internal hemorrhoids can also prolapse. That means they won’t retract back into the anus. Both prolapsed and thrombosed hemorrhoids can cause significant pain. Although hemorrhoids can be quite uncomfortable, they aren’t life threatening and oftengo away on their ownwithout treatment. If you ever have bleeding or black bowel movements, see your doctor. Bleeding can be caused by something other than hemorrhoids and must be evaluated. Also see your doctor if hemorrhoids don’t get better within 1 week of home treatment."
638,Hemmorrhoids,What are the causes and risk factors for hemorrhoids?,"Hemorrhoids occur when there’s too much pressure on the veins around your anus. Possible causes and risk factors include: straining during a bowel movement sitting for a long period of time, especially on the toilet having chronicconstipationor diarrhea having a family history of hemorrhoids engaging in consistent heavy lifting or other activities that strain your body havingobesity having anal sexual intercourse, which can irritate hemorrhoids being pregnant (an enlargeduteruspresses on the vein in thecolon, causing it to bulge) being over the age of 50"
639,Hemmorrhoids,How are hemorrhoids diagnosed?,"A visual examination of your anus may be enough to diagnose hemorrhoids. To confirm the diagnosis, your doctor may do a different examination to check for any abnormalities within the anus. This check is known as adigital rectal exam. During this exam, your doctor inserts a gloved and lubricated finger into your rectum. Depending on your risk factors for gastrointestinal disease, your doctor may order an additional test like ananoscopy,sigmoidoscopy, orcolonoscopy. Each of these tests involves your doctor using a small camera to diagnose any abnormalities in your anus, rectum, or colon. An anoscopy examines the inside of your anus, a sigmoidoscopy examines the last 2 feet (50 centimeters) of your colon, and a colonoscopy explores the entire colon. In these tests, a small fiber-optic camera fits into a small tube that’s inserted into your rectum. With this test, your doctor gets a clear view of the inside of your rectum so that they can examine the hemorrhoid up close. You can find a primary care doctor, gastroenterologist, or other specialist near you through theHealthline FindCare tool."
640,Hemmorrhoids,What are the treatment options for hemorrhoids?,"You can have hemorrhoids treated at home or at a doctor’s office. To minimize pain, soak in a warm tub of water for at least 10 minutes every day. You can also sit on a warm water bottle to relieve the pain ofexternal hemorrhoids. Find out how to make a warm compress at home. If the pain is unbearable, use an over-the-counter (OTC) medicatedsuppository, ointment, or cream to relieve the burning and itching. You can find hemorrhoid suppositories online or in stores. If you’re constipated, you can also use an OTCfiber supplementto help soften your stool. Two common supplements of this type arepsylliumand methylcellulose. OTC topical treatments, such as hydrocortisone or hemorrhoid cream, can ease your discomfort from hemorrhoids. Witch hazel pads can offer hemorrhoid relief as well. You can buy bothhydrocortisoneandhemorrhoid creamonline. Soaking your anus in asitz bathfor 10 to 15 minutes per day can also help. Practice good hygiene by cleaning your anus with warm water during a shower or bath every day. But don’t use soap, as soap can aggravate hemorrhoids. Also avoid using dry or rough toilet paper when you wipe after a bowel movement. Using a cold compress on your anus can help reduce hemorrhoid swelling. Pain relievers, such as acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or aspirin can also alleviate the pain or discomfort. Learn how to make a cold compress at home. Ifhome treatmentsaren’t helping with your hemorrhoids, your doctor might recommend getting arubber band ligation. This procedure involves the doctor cutting off circulation to the hemorrhoid by placing a rubber band around it. This causes loss of circulation to the hemorrhoid, forcing it to shrink. This procedure should only be performed by a medical professional. Don’t try this by yourself. If rubber band ligation isn’t an option in your case, your doctor may perform injection therapy, orsclerotherapy. In this procedure, your doctor injects a chemical into the blood vessel directly. This causes the hemorrhoid to reduce in size."
641,Hemmorrhoids,Prevention,"To prevent or avoid worsening hemorrhoids, avoid straining during a bowel movement. Also, try to increase yourwater intake. Drinking enough water can keep your stool from hardening. Use the restroom as soon as you feel a bowel movement coming on to prevent hemorrhoids from developing. Exercise regularly to prevent becomingconstipated, and avoid sitting for long periods, especially on hard surfaces like concrete or tile. Consuming foods that are high indietary fibercan minimize the risk of developing hemorrhoids in the future. Good dietary fiber sources include: whole wheat brown rice oatmeal pears carrots buckwheat bran Dietary fiberhelps create bulk in the intestines, which softens the stool, making it easier to pass."
642,Hemmorrhoids,Complications,"Complications from hemorrhoids are rare, but can include: blood clotsin the swollen vein bleeding iron deficiency anemiacaused by blood loss infection of an external hemorrhoid skin tags, or excess skin when an external hemorrhoid goes away"
643,Hemmorrhoids,Outlook,"With proper treatment, you’ll likely experience an improvement. Following your doctor’s directions and maintaining a regimen, includingexercisingand avoiding sitting for long periods of time, can also improve your outlook."
644,Hemmorrhoids,Summary,"Hemorrhoids are enlarged and bulging veins in and around the anus and rectum. They’re very common and caused by strain on the rectal veins. Risk factors include experiencing chronic constipation, pushing during bowel movements, having a family history of hemorrhoids, and being pregnant. Most hemorrhoids go away on their own. Treatments usually focus on relieving symptoms and may include taking warm baths and using a hydrocortisone or a hemorrhoid cream or suppository. Exercising, drinking plenty of water, and eating more fiber can all help relieve constipation and prevent hemorrhoids from forming in the future."
645,Hepatitis C,Overview,"Hepatitis C is a liver inflammation caused by the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which is transmitted through blood contact. It can be acute (short-term) or chronic (long-term). Symptoms of hepatitis C can range from fever and fatigue to jaundice and abdominal pain, but many people with chronic hepatitis C may not experience symptoms until liver damage occurs. Hepatitis C can be cured with antiviral medications, but without treatment, it can lead to cirrhosis, liver failure, or liver cancer. Regular testing is recommended for those at higher risk."
646,Hepatitis C,What is hepatitis C?,"Hepatitis C is an inflammation of the liver that develops after contracting the hepatitis C virus (HCV). HCV is bloodborne, which means you can only transmit or contract it through blood that carries it. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates around58 millionpeople globally are living with chronic hepatitis C. In the United States, hepatitis C is among the most commontypes of hepatitis, along with hepatitis A and B. There are vaccines to prevent hepatitis A and B, but a vaccine to prevent hepatitis C doesn’t yet exist. Hepatitis C can be either acute or chronic. Doctors generally defineacute hepatitis Cas the first 6 months after infection. It is most often asymptomatic. Any symptoms you experience may appear within 2–12 weeks after exposure, and they could clear up on their own. Chronic hepatitis Csymptoms, on the other hand, can develop (and worsen) over months or even years. You might not notice any symptoms until they become severe. Left untreated, hepatitis C can cause serious, even life threatening complications, including: liver scarring (cirrhosis) liver failure liver cancer"
647,Hepatitis C,What are the symptoms of hepatitis C?,"Symptoms may develop2–12 weeksafter exposure. The first 6 months after infection are considered acute. Acute hepatitis C may cause: fever fatigue nausea or stomach pain loss of appetite yellowed skin or eyes (jaundice) If your body doesn’t clear the virus, acute hepatitis C will become chronic. An estimated55–85%of people who contract HCV will eventually develop chronic hepatitis C. Chronic hepatitis C may cause: difficulty concentrating or remembering things (brain fog) difficulty sleeping general weakness (malaise) joint pain andmuscle aches unexpectedmood changes, including feelings of anxiety or depression unexplained weight loss These symptoms might affect you most of the time or improve for a while and then worsen. With chronic hepatitis C, you could also notice some symptoms of liver scarring and liver disease, including: indigestion,bloating, andstomach pain swelling in your feet and legs (edema) stool that’s gray orpale urine that’sdarker than usual"
648,Hepatitis C,"What causes hepatitis C, and who’s at risk?","Hepatitis C is a liver disease that occurs due to HCV infection. HCVtransmitsthrough blood-to-blood contact. Thiscan happenas a result of: using nonsterile needles, syringes, and other supplies to inject or inhale pregnancy or childbirth oral, vaginal, or analsex without a condomor other barrier method getting a tattooor a piercing with nonsterile equipment sharing personal hygiene items, like razors or toothbrushes You have an increased risk of HCV infection if you: have used injection drugs have asexual partnerwith hepatitis C haveHIV receivedhemodialysis treatmentfor an extended period received a blood transfusion or organ transplant before 1992 received clotting factor concentrates or other blood products before 1987 It’s important toconsult with a doctoror other healthcare professional if you suspect that you’ve had exposure to HCV. You can contract HCVmore than once."
649,Hepatitis C,How is hepatitis C diagnosed?,"Your healthcare professional will orderblood teststo check for the virus, starting with anantibody test. If you’ve ever had an HCV infection, your body will make hepatitis C antibodies part of its immune response. It may take 2–3 months afterexposurefor the test to detect antibodies. If the antibody test is positive, a nucleic acid test forribonucleic acid (RNA)can tell your healthcare professional whether the virus is currently active. In the event of an active HCV infection, tests to measure theamount of virusin your blood (viral load) and determine whichgenotypeyou have will guide an effective treatment plan. If blood test results suggest chronic hepatitis C or your healthcare professional believes you could have liver damage, they’ll order aliver function test. This test checks your blood for signs of heightened enzymes in your liver. A type of scan called ultrasound elastography can be used to assess liver damage. Aliver biopsycan also check for liver damage. A biopsy involves taking a small piece of tissue from your liver and testing it for cell abnormalities."
650,Hepatitis C,How is hepatitis C treated?,Oralmedicationscalled direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) work toremove HCVfrom your body and reduce the risk of liver damage. Treatment often includes two or more DAAs taken in combination. Some treatments are available as pills containing two or more drugs. Common brand names include: Zepatier Harvoni Epclusa Vosevi Mavyret A typical course oftreatmentlasts 12–24 weeks. Treatmentcan curehepatitis C95% of the time. Healthcare professionalsconsiderthe condition cured when tests can’t detect the virus in your blood 12 weeks after treatment ends.
651,Hepatitis C,What complications are possible with hepatitis C?,"HCV infection causes liver inflammation. Over time,this damagecan cause permanent scarring, known as cirrhosis. Cirrhosis interferes with blood flow and prevents your liver from functioning effectively. Anestimated 15–30%of people withchronic hepatitis Cdevelop cirrhosis within 20 years. Untreated or unmanaged cirrhosis can lead to: increased pressure in the veins that supply blood to your liver (portal hypertension) fluid buildup in the abdomen (ascites), which can lead to a severe infection called bacterialperitonitis fluid buildup in the legs (edema) an enlarged spleen (splenomegaly) enlarged veins (varices) in the esophagus or stomach, which can lead to life threatening bleeding (variceal hemorrhage) Advanced liver disease can also lead to: bone disease gum disease (periodontitis) liver cancer malnutrition toxin buildup in your brain (hepatic encephalopathy) It takes a long time for chronic hepatitis C to causeliver failure. Liver failure or end stage liver disease, happens slowly over months, often years. When your liver becomes unable to function properly, you’ll need atransplant."
652,Hepatitis C,What can you do to reduce your risk of HCV infection and hepatitis C?,"Experts have yet to develop an effectivehepatitis C vaccine, thoughresearchcontinues. Currently, the best way toreduce your risk of infectionis to avoid using any items that may have come into contact with someone else’s blood. You can do this by: not sharing razors, nail clippers, toothbrushes, needles, or syringes only getting tattoos or piercings at licensed facilities wearing gloves when cleaning or treating someone else’s wound using condoms or other barrier methods during sex If you think you could have hepatitis C, getting tested right away doesn’t just help you get treatment. It can also help you avoid transmitting the virus to others."
653,Hepatitis C,The bottom line,"You can contract HCV through blood-to-blood contact with someone who has the virus. While your body might clear an acute infection without treatment, hepatitis C often develops into a chronic condition. Prompt diagnosis and treatment can help reduce the risk of long-term complications, including severe liver damage and liver failure. Regular hepatitis C screenings can help with early detection. Consult with a healthcare professional to develop a screening schedule tailored to your individual level of risk. Read this article in Spanish."
654,Hernia,Overview,"Hernias typically result from muscle weakness and strain. Depending on the severity, doctors may suggest watchful waiting or surgery to repair the hernia. A hernia occurs when an organ pushes through an opening in the muscle or tissue that holds it in place. For example, the intestines may break through a weakened area in the abdominal wall. Many hernias occur in the abdomen between your chest and hips, but can also appear in the upper thigh and groin areas. Most hernias aren’t immediately life threatening, but they don’t go away on their own. Sometimes they can require surgery to prevent dangerous complications."
655,Hernia,Types of hernia,"There are several differenttypes of hernias. Keep reading to learn some of the most common types. Inguinal hernias are the most common type of hernia. They occur when the intestines push through a weak spot or tear in the lower abdominal wall, often in the inguinal canal. The inguinal canal is located in your groin. In males, it’s the area where the spermatic cord passes from the abdomen to the scrotum. This cord attaches to the testicles. In females, the inguinal canal contains a ligament (called the round ligament) that helps hold the uterus in place. Inguinal hernias are more common in males because the testicles descend through the inguinal canal shortly after birth. The canal is supposed to close almost completely behind them. Sometimes the canal doesn’t close properly, leaving a weakened area. However,inguinal hernias can also occur in females. Doctors mayrepair these hernias surgically. A hiatal hernia occurs when part of your stomach protrudes through thediaphragminto your chest cavity. The diaphragm is a sheet of muscle that helps you breathe by contracting and drawing air into the lungs. It separates the organs in your abdomen from those in your chest. This type of hernia is most common in people over 50. If a child has the condition, it typically results from a congenital birth irregularity. Hiatal hernias almost always causegastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). In GERD, the stomach contents leak backward into theesophagus, causing a burning sensation. Doctors may recommendfollowing a specific diet, taking care when exercising, andsurgical repairfor some people. Umbilical hernias can affect children and babies. They occur when the intestines bulge through the abdominal wall near the belly button. You may notice a bulge in or near your child’s belly button, especially when crying. An umbilical hernia is the only kind that often goes away as the abdominal wall muscles get stronger. This typically happens when the child is1 or 2 years old. If the hernia hasn’t gone away by 5 years of age, doctors may performsurgery to correct it. Adults can also have umbilical hernias. They can occur from repeated strain on the abdomen due to conditions such as obesity, fluid in the abdomen (ascites), orpregnancy. A ventral hernia happens when tissue bulges through an opening in the muscles of your abdomen. You may notice that a ventral hernia decreases in size when lying down. Although a ventral hernia can be present from birth, acquiring one at some point during your lifetime is more common. Common factors in ventral hernia formation include: obesity pregnancy strenuous activity Ventral hernias can also occur at the site of a surgical incision. This is called anincisional herniaand can result from surgical scarring or weakness of the abdominal muscles at the surgical site. They generally require surgery to repair, as complications likehernia strangulationare possible if they’re left untreated."
656,Hernia,Hernia symptoms,"The most common symptom of a hernia is abulgeorlumpin the affected area. For example, in the case of an inguinal hernia, you may notice a lump on either side of your pubic bone where your groin and thigh meet. You may find that the lump “disappears” when lying down. You’re more likely to feel your hernia through touch when standing up, bending down, or coughing. Discomfort or painin the area around the lump may also be present. Some types of hernia, such as hiatal hernias, can have more specific symptoms. These can include: heartburn trouble swallowing burning or pain in the chest In many cases, hernias have no symptoms. You may not know you have a hernia unless it shows up while undergoing a medical exam for an unrelated problem or aroutine physical. Seek immediate medical attention if you experience any of these symptoms with your hernia: a bulge that becomes red or purple pain that suddenly gets worse nausea vomiting fever not being able to pass gas or have bowel movements"
657,Hernia,Hernia causes,"Hernias result from a combination of muscleweaknessandstrain. Depending on its cause, a hernia can develop quickly or slowly over time. Common causes of muscle weakness or strain that can lead to a hernia include: a congenital condition, which occurs during development in the womb and is present from birth aging damage from an injury or surgery strenuous exercise or lifting heavy weights chronic coughingorchronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) pregnancy, especially having multiple pregnancies constipation, which causes you to strain when having a bowel movement being overweight or havingobesity ascites, which can develop if the liver stops working as it should Certain risk factors make you more likely to develop a hernia. They include: being bornprematurelyor having alow birth weight being over 50 chronic cough (likely due to the repetitive increase in abdominal pressure) cystic fibrosis pregnancy chronic constipation being overweight or having obesity smoking, which leads to the weakening of connective tissue a personal or family history of hernias"
658,Hernia,Hernia diagnosis,"To diagnose your condition, a doctor will first perform a physical examination. During this examination, the doctor may feel for a bulge in your abdominal or groin area that gets larger when you stand, cough, or strain. Your doctor will then take your medical history. They may ask you a variety of questions, including: When did you first notice the bulge? Have you experienced any other symptoms? Do you think something in particular may have caused it to occur? Tell me a little bit about your lifestyle. Does your occupation involve heavy lifting? Do you exercise rigorously? Do you lift weights professionally or recreationally? Do you have a history of smoking? Do you have a personal or family history of hernias? Have you had any surgeries in your abdominal or groin area? Your doctor will also likely use imaging tests to aid in their diagnosis. These can include: Abdominal ultrasound:Anabdominal ultrasounduses high-frequency sound waves to create an image of the structures inside the body. Abdominal CT scan:Anabdominal CT scancombines X-rays with computer technology to produce an image. Abdominal MRI scan:Anabdominal MRI scanuses a combination of strong magnets and radio waves to create an image. If your doctor suspects a hiatal hernia, they may use other tests that allow them to assess the inside of your stomach: X-rays of your digestive tract:A healthcare professional will have you drink a liquid containing diatrizoate meglumine/diatrizoate sodium (Gastrografin) or aliquid barium solution(barium swallow). These liquids help your digestive tract appear highlighted on X-ray images. Endoscopy:During anendoscopy, a healthcare professional threads a small camera attached to a tube down your throat and into your esophagus and stomach."
659,Hernia,Hernia treatment,"The only way toeffectively treat a herniais through surgical repair. However, some people may not require surgery for treatment. Whether or not you need surgery depends on thesize of your herniaand the severity of your symptoms. Your doctor may want to monitor your hernia for possible complications. This approach is called watchful waiting. In some cases, wearing a truss, a supportive undergarment that helps to hold the hernia in place, may help to ease the symptoms of a hernia. Always see your doctor to ensure a truss fits properly before using it. If you have a hiatal hernia, over-the-counter (OTC) and prescription medications that reduce stomach acid can relieve your discomfort and improve symptoms. These include: antacids H2 receptor blockers proton pump inhibitors (PPIs)"
660,Hernia,Home remedies for hernia,"Home remedieswon’t cure a hernia, but you can take steps to help ease your symptoms. Increasing your fiber intake may help relieve constipation. Constipation can cause straining during bowel movements, which can aggravate a hernia.High fiber foodsinclude whole grains, fruits, and vegetables. Dietary changes can also help with the symptoms of a hiatal hernia. Some things that may help include: avoiding large or heavy meals not lyingdown or bending over after a meal maintaining a moderate body weight avoidingfoods that may cause acid reflux, such as spicy foods and tomato-based foods. Additionally, if you smoke,giving up cigarettesmay also help."
661,Hernia,Hernia exercises,"Exercise may work to strengthen muscles around the hernia and promote weight loss, helping reduce some symptoms. A2024 studyinvestigated the effects of an exercise program on people undergoing hernia repair surgery. The people who completed the exercise program had fewer complications following surgery. Remember that some types of exercise, such as weightlifting or exercises that strain the abdomen, may increase pressure in the area of the hernia, which may cause the hernia to bulge more. The same is true for exercises that are done improperly. If you have a hernia, discussing exercise with a doctor or physical therapist is best. They can work closely with you to let you know which exercises are best for you andhow to exercise safely with a hernia."
662,Hernia,Hernia repair surgery,"If your hernia is growing or causing pain, a surgeon may decide it’s best to operate. If the hernia causes an extra hole in your abdominal wall, your surgeon may repair it by sewing the hole closed during surgery. This is commonly done bypatching the hole with surgical mesh. Sometimes, a hernia results in one of the body’s passageways opening even wider than it should. This can occur in the space where the esophagus is meant to pass through the diaphragm. In these cases, surgery can be performed to tighten the opening. Doctors can repair hernias with either open orlaparoscopicsurgery, depending on your specific circumstances. During open surgery, the surgeon makes an incision close to the site of the hernia and then pushes the bulging tissue back into the abdomen. They then sew the area shut, sometimes reinforcing it with surgical mesh. Finally, they close the incision. Laparoscopic surgery uses a tiny camera and miniaturized surgical equipment to repair the hernia. It only requires a few small incisions and is less damaging to the surrounding tissue. Not all hernias are suitable for laparoscopic surgery. If your hernia requires an open surgical repair, your surgeon will work with you to determine which technique is best for your condition. After your surgery, you may experience pain around the surgical site. A surgeon typically prescribes medication to help ease this discomfort while you recover. Be sure to carefully follow your surgeon’s instructions involvingwound careand contact them promptly if you notice any symptoms ofinfection, such as: fever discoloration or drainage at the site pain that suddenly worsens Following hernia repair, you may be unable to move around normally for several weeks. You’ll need to avoid any strenuous activity. Additionally, you should avoid lifting objectsheavier than 10 pounds (4.5 kilograms)during this period. This is slightly more than the weight of a gallon of milk. Your surgeon can tell you how long you should follow lift restrictions. They may recommend a gradual return to activity. Open surgery often requires a longer recovery process than laparoscopic surgery. Your surgeon will let you know when you can return to your typical routine."
663,Hernia,Hernia recovery,"It’s important to recognize the symptoms of a hernia and to see a doctor if you suspect that you have one. An untreated hernia won’t go away by itself, and sometimes, hernias can cause complications that are life threatening. A doctor can assess your hernia and determine the best treatment option. Early medical care and lifestyle changes can minimize symptoms. However, surgery is the only way to resolve a hernia. There are different types of hernia repair surgeries, and a surgeon can advise on which is right for your condition. The outlook for people who undergo hernia repair surgery is generally very good. However, it can depend on the nature of the hernia, your symptoms, and your overall health. In some cases, the hernia may recur after repair surgery."
664,Hernia,Hernia in babies,"Between10 and 25%of babies are born with an umbilical hernia. This type of hernia is also more common in babies who are born prematurely or with a low birth weight. Umbilical hernias occur near the belly button. They form when the muscles surrounding the hole left by the umbilical cord don’t close properly. This causes a portion of the intestine to bulge out. If your child has an umbilical hernia, you may notice it more when crying or coughing. Umbilical hernias in children are typically painless. However, some symptoms need emergency medical attention. These include: pain vomiting swelling at the hernia site It’s best to talk with your child’s pediatrician if you notice they have an umbilical hernia. Umbilical hernias typically disappear when a child is 1 or 2 years old. If they don’t disappear by age 5, doctors may recommend surgery to repair them."
665,Hernia,Pregnancy and hernia,"If you’re pregnant and think that you have a hernia, be sure to talk with a doctor. They can evaluate it and determine if it poses any health risks. Often, hernia repair can wait until after delivery. If a small hernia that’s present before or during the pregnancy begins to get larger or cause discomfort, a doctor may recommend surgery to repair it.Experts generally recommendhaving this surgery during thesecond trimester. Hernias repaired in the past may return with later pregnancies. This is because pregnancy strains abdominal muscle tissue that may have been weakened by surgery. Hernias can also occur following acesarean delivery (C-section). During a cesarean delivery, a doctor makes an incision into the abdomen and uterus. The baby is then delivered through these incisions. An incisional hernia can sometimes occur at the site of a cesarean delivery."
666,Hernia,Hernia complications,"Sometimes an untreated hernia can lead to potentially serious complications. Your hernia may grow and cause more symptoms. It may also put too much pressure on nearby tissues, which can cause swelling and pain in the surrounding area. A portion of your intestine could also become trapped in the abdominal wall. This is called incarceration. Incarceration canobstructyour bowel and cause severepain,nausea, or constipation. A bowel obstruction can become life threatening and requires immediate medical care. If the trapped section of your intestines doesn’t get enough blood flow,strangulationoccurs. This can cause the intestinal tissue to become infected or die. A strangulated hernia is life threatening and requires immediate medical care."
667,Hernia,Hernia prevention,"You can’t always prevent a hernia from developing. Sometimes a hernia occurs because of an existing inherited condition or a previous surgery. However, you can make some simple lifestyle adjustments to help lower your risk of a hernia. These steps aim to reduce the strain on your body. Here are a few general prevention tips: Avoid liftingweights that are too heavy for you. If you must lift something heavy, bend at your knees, not your waist or back. Also, avoid holding your breath when lifting heavy objects. Instead, exhale during the lift to decrease the chance of a hiatal hernia developing or worsening. Perform exercises that help tostrengthen the muscles of your abdomen. Get medicare care when you’re sick to avoid developing a persistent cough. Maintain a moderate body weight. Try not to strainwhile having a bowel movementor during urination. Eat enough high fiber foodsto prevent constipation. If you smoke,consider quitting. You can work with your doctor to create a smoking cessation plan that’s right for you."
668,Hernia,The bottom line,"A hernia develops when an organ, like an intestine, pushes through an opening in the muscle or tissue that holds it in place. There are many types of hernias. Hernias typically cause a visible bulge in the abdomen that’s more visible when standing. Some people may also develop additional symptoms, such as acid reflux, depending on the type of hernia they have. There is no way to resolve a hernia without surgery. However, surgery isn’t always needed, especially for mild hernias. A doctor may instead recommend watchful waiting, which involves monitoring the hernia and only treating it with surgery if it worsens. You may need to take care while exercising to prevent a hernia from worsening."
669,Hip Pain,Overview,Hip pain is the general term for pain in or around the hip joint. It isn’t always felt in the hip itself but may instead be felt in the groin or thigh. Read on to learn about the causes of hip pain and how it’s diagnosed and treated.
670,Hip Pain,What causes hip pain?,"Certain injuries or conditions can cause hip pain. The most common cause of acute hip pain is inflamed tendons, ortendonitis. This is often due to too much exercise. This condition can be very painful, but it usually heals within a few days. The most common cause of long-term hip pain is arthritis. Arthritis can cause pain, stiff and tender joints, and difficulty walking. There are various types of arthritis: Osteoarthritis (OA)can be the result of age-related wearing down of the cartilage that surrounds the joints. Trauma to a joint, like a fracture, may cause traumatic arthritis like osteoarthritis. Infectious arthritisis due to an infection in the joint causing the destruction of cartilage. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA)is due to the body’s immune system launching an attack on the joints. This type of arthritis may eventually destroyjoint cartilageand bones. Osteoarthritis is much more common than rheumatoid arthritis. Another possible cause of hip pain istrochanteric bursitis. This condition occurs when the bursa, which is a liquid-filled sac near the hip joint, becomes inflamed. A number of factors can cause trochanteric bursitis, including hip injury, overuse of the joints or posture problems. Other conditions such as RA can also cause hip pain. This condition is muchmore common in women than in men. Hip fractures are common in older adults and in those who have osteoporosis, which is a weakening of the bones due to age or other factors. Hip fractures cause very sudden, severe hip pain, and they require immediate medical attention. There are complications that can arise from a fractured hip, such as a blood clot in the leg. A hip fracture usually requires surgery to be corrected. You’ll most likely need to have physical therapy to recover."
671,Hip Pain,Less common causes,"There are other, less common conditions that can cause hip pain. These includesnapping hip syndromeandosteonecrosis, or avascular necrosis. Snapping hip syndrome, which most commonly occurs in dancers or athletes, is characterized by a snapping sound or feeling in the hip. This snapping may occur when you’re walking or getting up out of a chair, for example. The condition is usually painless, but can cause pain in some cases. Snapping hip with pain is usually a sign of cartilage tear or fragments of material in the hip. Osteonecrosis, or avascular necrosis, occurs when blood doesn’t reach the bones, either temporarily or permanently. This can lead to the loss of the supporting bone. In this condition, the cartilage is normal initially but will eventually collapse as it progresses. Eventually, bones may break or crumple. It’s not always clear what causes osteonecrosis. Joint injury, heavy use of steroid medications or alcohol, and cancer treatments may put you at greater risk for this condition. But in many cases, the cause is never determined."
672,Hip Pain,When should I seek emergency care?,"Contact your doctor if you have hip pain that lasts longer than a few days. They can come up with a plan to manage pain and treat your condition. However, you should contact your doctor immediately if the hip is bleeding or you can see exposed bone or muscle, a popping noise occurs, or you can’t bear weight. Also, seek immediate help if your hip joint appears deformed or is swollen, or if you have severe pain. Prompt medical attention is necessary for hip pain accompanied by any of the following: swelling tenderness soreness warmth redness These may be signs of serious conditions, including septic arthritis, which is a joint infection. If it’s left untreated, septic arthritis can lead to deformed joints and osteoarthritis. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
673,Hip Pain,How is hip pain diagnosed?,"For pain that could be related to a condition such as arthritis, your doctor will ask you a range of questions, including: Is the pain worse at a time of day? Does it affect your ability to walk? When did your symptoms first appear? You may need to walk around to let your doctor observe the joint in motion. They’ll measure the motion in the normal and abnormal hip and compare the two. To diagnose arthritis, your doctor will perform fluid and imaging tests. Fluid tests involve taking samples of blood, urine, and joint fluid for testing in a laboratory. Imaging tests may include: X-rays CT scans MRI scans ultrasounds Imaging tests will provide your doctor with detailed views of your bones, cartilage, and other tissues."
674,Hip Pain,What are the treatment options for hip pain?,"The treatment of hip pain depends on the cause. For exercise-related pain, rest is usually enough to allow the hip to heal. This type of pain is typically gone within a few days. If you have arthritis, your doctor will prescribe medications to relieve pain and stiffness. Your doctor may refer you to a specialist who can offer further advice and a physical therapist who can show you how to do exercises to help keep the joint mobile. For injuries, treatment typically involves bed rest and medications, such asnaproxen (Aleve), to relieve swelling and pain. Hip fractures, malformation of the hip, and some injuries may require surgical intervention to repair or replace the hip. In hip replacement surgery, a surgeon replaces the damaged hip joint with an artificial one. Although hip replacement surgery will take some physical therapy to get used to the new joint, this is a common surgery that’s most often successful. Some holistic therapies can provide relief from hip pain. Make sure you discuss treatment options with your doctor before undergoing any alternative treatment. Possible holistic therapies include seeing achiropractorfor an adjustment or havingacupuncture. This involves the temporary placement of very small needles into key body areas to promote healing."
675,Hip Pain,What is the long-term outlook?,"After you know the cause of your hip pain and treat the pain correctly, you can successfully manage it. For very minor injuries and exercise-related accidents, no treatment may be necessary and your hip may soon return to normal. However, for more serious conditions, such as arthritis, fractures, and necrosis, the symptoms are likely to worsen until you receive treatment. Talk to your doctor so they can help you with a treatment plan."
676,HIV/AIDS,Overview,"HIV is a virus that weakens the immune system, and if left untreated, can lead to stage 3 HIV, but with proper treatment, people with HIV can live long and productive lives. Early detection and consistent use of HIV treatments are crucial in management, preventing its progression, and reducing the risk of transmission. HIV is transmitted through specific bodily fluids, not through casual contact, and preventive measures like safe sex practices and avoiding shared needles can significantly reduce the risk of transmission."
677,HIV/AIDS,What is HIV?,"HIV is a virus that damages the immune system. Untreated HIV affects and kills CD4 cells, which are a type of immune cell called T cell. Over time, as HIV kills more CD4 cells, the body is more likely to get various types of conditions and cancers. HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids that include: blood semen vaginal and rectal fluids breast milk The virus isn’t transferred in air or water, or through casual contact. Because HIV inserts itself into the DNA of cells, it’s a lifelong condition and currently there’s no drug that eliminates HIV from the body, although many scientists are working to find one. However, with medical care, including treatment called antiretroviral therapy, it’s possible to manage HIV and live with the virus for many years. Without treatment, a person with HIV is likely to develop a serious condition called the Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, known as AIDS. At that point, the immune system is too weak to successfully respond against other diseases, infections, and conditions. Untreated, life expectancy with end stage AIDS is about3 years. With antiretroviral therapy, HIV can be well-managed, and life expectancy can be nearly the same as someone who has not contracted HIV. It’s estimated that1.2 millionAmericans are currently living with HIV. Of those people, 1 in 7 don’t know they have the virus. HIV can cause changes throughout the body. Learn about the effects of HIV on the different systems in the body."
678,HIV/AIDS,What is AIDS?,"AIDS is a disease that can develop in people with HIV. It’s the most advanced stage of HIV. But just because a person has HIV doesn’t mean AIDS will develop. HIV kills CD4 cells. Healthy adults generally have a CD4 count of500 to 1,600per cubic millimeter. A person with HIV whose CD4 count falls below200per cubic millimeter will be diagnosed with AIDS. A person can also be diagnosed with AIDS if they have HIV and develop anopportunistic infectionor cancer that’s rare in people who don’t have HIV. An opportunistic infection such asPneumocystis jirovecipneumonia is one that only occurs in a severely immunocompromised person, such as someone with advanced HIV infection (AIDS). Untreated, HIV can progress to AIDS within a decade. There’s currently no cure for AIDS, and without treatment, life expectancy after diagnosis is about3 years. This may be shorter if the person develops a severe opportunistic illness. However, treatment with antiretroviral drugs can prevent AIDS from developing. If AIDS does develop, it means that the immune system is severely compromised, that is, weakened to the point where it can no longer successfully respond against most diseases and infections. That makes the person living with AIDS vulnerable to a wide range of illnesses, including: pneumonia tuberculosis oral thrush, a fungal condition in the mouth or throat cytomegalovirus (CMV), a type of herpes virus cryptococcal meningitis, a fungal condition in the brain toxoplasmosis, a brain condition caused by a parasite cryptosporidiosis, a condition caused by an intestinal parasite cancer, includingKaposi sarcoma (KS)andlymphoma The shortened life expectancy linked with untreated AIDS isn’t a direct result of the syndrome itself. Rather, it’s a result of the diseases and complications that arise from having an immune system weakened by AIDS. Learn more about possible complications that can arise from HIV and AIDS."
679,HIV/AIDS,Early symptoms of HIV,"The first few weeks after someone contracts HIV is called theacute infection stage. During this time, the virus reproduces rapidly. The person’s immune system responds by producing HIV antibodies, which are proteins that take measures to respond against infection. During this stage, some people have no symptoms at first. However, many people experience symptoms in the first month or so after contracting the virus, but they often don’t realize HIV causes those symptoms. This is because symptoms of the acute stage can be very similar to those of the flu or other seasonal viruses, such as: they may be mild to severe they may come and go they may last anywhere from a few days to several weeks Early symptoms of HIV can include: fever chills swollen lymph nodes general aches and pains skin rash sore throat headache nausea upset stomach Because these symptoms are similar to common illnesses like the flu, the person who has them might not think they need to see a healthcare provider. And even if they do, their healthcare provider might suspect thefluormononucleosisand might not even consider HIV. Whether a person has symptoms or not, during this period theirviral loadis very high. The viral load is the amount of HIV found in the bloodstream. A high viral load means that HIV can be easily transmitted to someone else during this time. Initial HIV symptoms usually resolve within a few months as the person enters the chronic, or clinical latency, stage of HIV. This stage can last many years or even decades with treatment. HIV symptoms can vary from person to person. Learn more about the early symptoms of HIV."
680,HIV/AIDS,What are the symptoms of HIV?,"After the first month or so, HIV enters the clinical latency stage. This stage can last from a few years to a few decades. Some people don’t have any symptoms during this time, while others may have minimal or nonspecific symptoms. A nonspecific symptom is a symptom that doesn’t pertain to one specific disease or condition. These nonspecific symptoms may include: headaches and other aches and pains swollen lymph nodes recurrent fevers night sweats fatigue nausea vomiting diarrhea weight loss skin rashes recurrent oral or vaginal yeast infections pneumonia shingles As with the early stage, HIV is still transferable during this time even without symptoms and can be transmitted to another person. However, a person won’t know they have HIV unless they get tested. If someone has these symptoms and thinks they may have been exposed to HIV, it’s important that they get tested. HIV symptoms at this stage may come and go, or they may progress rapidly. This progression can be slowed substantially with treatment. With the consistent use of this antiretroviral therapy, chronic HIV can last for decades and will likely not develop into AIDS, if treatment was started early enough. Learn more about how HIV symptoms can progress over time."
681,HIV/AIDS,Is rash a symptom of HIV?,"Many people with HIV experience changes to their skin. Rash is often one of the first symptoms of an HIV infection. Generally, an HIV rash appears as multiple small red lesions that are flat and raised. HIV makes someone more susceptible to skin problems because the virus destroys immune system cells that take measures against infection. Co-infections that can cause rash include: molluscum contagiosum herpes simplex shingles The cause of the rash determines: how it looks how long it lasts how it can be treated depends on the cause While rash can be caused by HIV co-infections, it can also be caused by medication. Some drugs used to treat HIV or other conditions can cause a rash. This type of rash usually appears within a week or 2 weeks of starting a new medication. Sometimes the rash will clear up on its own. If it doesn’t, a change in medications may be needed. Rash due to an allergic reaction to medication can be serious. Other symptoms of an allergic reaction include: trouble breathing or swallowing dizziness fever Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS) is a rare allergic reaction to HIV medication. Symptoms include fever and swelling of the face and tongue. A blistering rash, which can involve the skin and mucous membranes, appears and spreads quickly. When30 percentof the skin is affected, it’s called toxic epidermal necrolysis, which is a life threatening condition. If this develops, emergency medical care is needed. While rash can be linked with HIV or HIV medications, it’s important to keep in mind that rashes are common and can have many other causes. Learn more about HIV rash."
682,HIV/AIDS,HIV symptoms in men: Is there a difference?,"Symptoms of HIV vary from person to person, but they’re similar in men and women. These symptoms can come and go or get progressively worse. If a person has been exposed to HIV, they may also have been exposed to other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). These include: gonorrhea chlamydia syphilis trichomoniasis Men, and those with a penis, may be more likely than women to notice symptoms of STIs such as sores on their genitals. However, men typically don’t seek medical care as often as women. Learn more about HIV symptoms in men."
683,HIV/AIDS,HIV symptoms in women: Is there a difference?,"For the most part, symptoms of HIV are similar in men and women. However, symptoms they experience overall may differ based on the different risks men and women face if they have HIV. Both men and women with HIV are at increased risk for STIs. However, women, and those with a vagina, may be less likely than men to notice small spots or other changes to their genitals. In addition, women with HIV are at increased risk for: recurrentvaginal yeast infections other vaginal infections, including bacterial vaginosis pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) menstrual cycle changes human papillomavirus (HPV), which can causegenital wartsand lead tocervical cancer While not related to HIV symptoms, another risk for women with HIV is that the virus can be transmitted to a baby during pregnancy. However, antiretroviral therapy is considered safe during pregnancy. Women who are treated with antiretroviral therapy are at very low risk for transmitting HIV to their baby during pregnancy and delivery. Breastfeeding is also affected in women with HIV. The virus can be transferred to a baby through breast milk. In the United States and other settings where formula is accessible and safe, it’s recommended that women with HIVnotbreastfeed their babies. For these women, use of formula is encouraged. Options besides formula includepasteurized banked human milk. For women who may have been exposed to HIV, it’s important to know what symptoms to look for. Learn more about HIV symptoms in women."
684,HIV/AIDS,What are the symptoms of AIDS?,"AIDS refers to acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. With this condition, the immune system is weakened due to HIV that’s typically gone untreated for many years. If HIV is found and treated early with antiretroviral therapy, a person will usually not develop AIDS. People with HIV may develop AIDS if their HIV is not diagnosed until late or if they know they have HIV but don’t consistently take their antiretroviral therapy. They may also develop AIDS if they have a type of HIV that’s resistant to (doesn’t respond to) the antiretroviral treatment. Without proper and consistent treatment, people living with HIV can develop AIDS sooner. By that time, the immune system is quite damaged and has a harder time generating a response to infection and disease. With the use of antiretroviral therapy, a person can maintain a chronic HIV diagnosis without developing AIDS for decades. Symptoms of AIDS can include: recurrent fever chronic swollen lymph glands, especially of the armpits, neck, and groin chronic fatigue night sweats dark splotches under the skin or inside the mouth, nose, or eyelids sores, spots, or lesions of the mouth and tongue, genitals, or anus bumps, lesions, or rashes of the skin recurrent or chronic diarrhea rapid weight loss neurologic problems such as trouble concentrating, memory loss, and confusion anxiety and depression Antiretroviral therapy controls the virus and usually prevents progression to AIDS. Other infections and complications of AIDS can also be treated. That treatment must be tailored to the individual needs of the person."
685,HIV/AIDS,HIV transmission facts,"Anyone can contract HIV. The virus is transmitted in bodily fluids that include: blood semen vaginal and rectal fluids breast milk Some of the ways HIV is transferred from person to person include: through vaginal or anal sex — the most common route of transmission by sharing needles, syringes, and other items for injection drug use by sharing tattoo equipment without sterilizing it between uses during pregnancy, labor, or delivery from a pregnant person to their baby during breastfeeding through “premastication,” or chewing a baby’s food before feeding it to them through exposure to the blood, semen, vaginal and rectal fluids, and breast milk of someone living with HIV, such as through a needle stick The virus can also be transmitted through a blood transfusion or organ and tissue transplant. However, rigorous testing for HIV among blood, organ, and tissue donors ensures that this is very rare in the United States. It’s theoretically possible, but considered extremely rare, for HIV to be transmitted through: oral sex (only if there are bleeding gums or open sores in the person’s mouth) being bitten by a person with HIV (only if the saliva is bloody or there are open sores in the person’s mouth) contact between broken skin, wounds, or mucous membranes and the blood of someone living with HIV HIV does NOT transfer through: skin-to-skin contact hugging, shaking hands, or kissing air or water sharing food or drinks, including drinking fountains saliva, tears, or sweat (unless mixed with the blood of a person with HIV) sharing a toilet, towels, or bedding mosquitoes or other insects It’s important to note that if a person living with HIV is being treated and has a persistently undetectable viral load, it’s virtually impossible to transmit the virus to another person. Learn more about HIV transmission."
686,HIV/AIDS,Causes of HIV,"HIV is a variation of a virus that can be transmitted to African chimpanzees. Scientists suspect the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) jumped from chimps to humans when people consumed chimpanzee meat containing the virus. Once inside the human population, the virus mutated into what we now know as HIV. This likely occurred as long ago as the 1920s. HIV spread from person to person throughout Africa over the course of several decades. Eventually, the virus migrated to other parts of the world. Scientists first discovered HIV in a human blood sample in 1959. It’s thought that HIV has existed in the United States since the 1970s, but it didn’t start to hit public consciousness until the 1980s. Learn more about the history of HIV and AIDS in the United States."
687,HIV/AIDS,Treatment options for HIV,"Treatment should begin as soon as possible after a diagnosis of HIV, regardless of viral load. The main treatment for HIV is antiretroviral therapy, a combination of daily medications that stop the virus from reproducing. This helps protect CD4 cells, keeping the immune system strong enough to take measures against disease. Antiretroviral therapy helps keep HIV from progressing to AIDS. It also helps reduce the risk of transmitting HIV to others. When treatment is effective, the viral load will be “undetectable.” The person still has HIV, but the virus is not visible in test results. However, the virus is still in the body. And if that person stops taking antiretroviral therapy, the viral load will increase again, and the HIV can again start attacking CD4 cells. Learn more about how HIV treatments work."
688,HIV/AIDS,HIV medications,"Many antiretroviral therapy medicationsare approved to treat HIV. They work to prevent HIV from reproducing and destroying CD4 cells, which help the immune system generate a response to infection. This helps reduce the risk of developing complications related to HIV, as well as transmitting the virus to others. These antiretroviral medications are grouped into seven classes: nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) protease inhibitors fusion inhibitors CCR5 antagonists, also known as entry inhibitors integrase strand transfer inhibitors attachment inhibitors TheU.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)generally recommends a starting regimen of three HIV medications from at least two of these drug classes. This combination helps prevent HIV from forming resistance to medications. (Resistance means the drug no longer works to treat the virus.) Many of the antiretroviral medications are combined with others so that a person with HIV typically takes only one or two pills a day. A healthcare provider will help a person with HIV choose a regimen based on their overall health and personal circumstances. These medications must be taken every day, exactly as prescribed. If they’re not taken appropriately, viral resistance can develop, and a new regimen may be needed. Blood testing will help determine if the regimen is working to keep the viral load down and the CD4 count up. If an antiretroviral therapy regimen isn’t working, the person’s healthcare provider will switch them to a different regimen that’s more effective. Side effects of antiretroviral therapy vary and may include nausea, headache, and dizziness. These symptoms are often temporary and disappear with time. Serious side effects can include swelling of the mouth and tongue and liver or kidney damage. If side effects are severe, the medications can be adjusted. Costs for antiretroviral therapy vary according to geographic location and type of insurance coverage. Some pharmaceutical companies have assistance programs to help lower the cost. Learn more about the drugs used to treat HIV."
689,HIV/AIDS,HIV and AIDS: What’s the connection?,"To develop AIDS, a person has to have contracted HIV. But having HIV doesn’t necessarily mean that someone will develop AIDS. Cases of HIV progress through three stages: stage 1:acute stage, the first few weeks after transmission stage 2:clinical latency, or chronic stage stage 3:AIDS As HIV lowers the CD4 cell count, the immune system weakens. A typical adult’s CD4 count is 500 to 1,500 per cubic millimeter. A person with a count below 200 is considered to have AIDS. How quickly a case of HIV progresses through the chronic stage varies significantly from person to person. Without treatment, it can last up to a decade before advancing to AIDS. With treatment, it can last indefinitely. There’s currently no cure for HIV, but it can be managed. People with HIV often have a near-normal lifespan with early treatment with antiretroviral therapy. Along those same lines, there’s technically no cure for AIDS currently. However, treatment can increase a person’s CD4 count to the point where they’re considered to no longer have AIDS. (This point is a count of 200 or higher.) Also, treatment can typically help manage opportunistic infections. HIV and AIDS are related, but they’re not the same thing. Learn more about the difference between HIV and AIDS."
690,HIV/AIDS,Causes of AIDS,"AIDS is caused by HIV. A person can’t get AIDS if they haven’t contracted HIV. Healthy individuals have a CD4 count of 500 to 1,500 per cubic millimeter. Without treatment, HIV continues to multiply and destroy CD4 cells. If a person’s CD4 count falls below 200, they have AIDS. Also, if someone with HIV develops an opportunistic infection associated with HIV, they can still be diagnosed with AIDS, even if their CD4 count is above 200."
691,HIV/AIDS,What tests are used to diagnose HIV?,"Several differenttestscan be used to diagnose HIV. Healthcare providers determine which test is best for each person. Antibody/antigen tests are the most commonly used tests. They can show positive results typically within18–45 daysafter someone initially contracts HIV. These tests check the blood for antibodies and antigens. An antibody is a type of protein the body makes to respond to an infection. An antigen, on the other hand, is the part of the virus that activates the immune system. These tests check the blood solely for antibodies. Between23 and 90 daysafter transmission, most people will develop detectable HIV antibodies, which can be found in the blood or saliva. These tests are done using blood tests or mouth swabs, and there’s no preparation necessary. Some tests provide results in 30 minutes or less and can be performed in a healthcare provider’s office or clinic. Other antibody tests can be done at home: OraQuick HIV Test.An oral swab provides results in as little as 20 minutes. Home Access HIV-1 Test System.After the person pricks their finger, they send a blood sample to a licensed laboratory. They can remain anonymous and call for results the next business day. If someone suspects they’ve been exposed to HIV but tested negative in a home test, they should repeat the test in 3 months. If they have a positive result, they should follow up with their healthcare provider to confirm. This expensive test isn’t used for general screening. It’s for people who have early symptoms of HIV or have a known risk factor. This test doesn’t look for antibodies; it looks for the virus itself. It takes from 5 to 21 days for HIV to bedetectablein the blood. This test is usually accompanied or confirmed by an antibody test. Today, it’s easier than ever to get tested for HIV. Learn more about HIV home testing options."
692,HIV/AIDS,What’s the HIV window period?,"As soon as someone contracts HIV, it starts to reproduce in their body. The person’s immune system reacts to the antigens (parts of the virus) by producing antibodies (cells that take countermeasures against the virus). The time between exposure to HIV and when it becomes detectable in the blood is called the HIV window period. Most people develop detectable HIV antibodies within 23 to 90 days after transmission. If a person takes an HIV test during the window period, it’s likely they’ll receive a negative result. However, they can still transmit the virus to others during this time. If someone thinks they may have been exposed to HIV but tested negative during this time, they should repeat the test in a few months to confirm (the timing depends on the test used). And during that time, they need to use condoms or other barrier methods to prevent possibly spreading HIV. Someone who tests negative during the window might benefit frompost-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). This is medication takenafteran exposure to prevent getting HIV. PEP needs to be taken as soon as possible after the exposure; it should be taken no later than 72 hours after exposure but ideally before then. Another way to prevent getting HIV ispre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP).A combination of HIV drugs taken before potential exposure to HIV, PrEP can lower the risk of contracting or transmitting HIV when taken consistently. Timing is important when testing for HIV. Learn more about how timing affects HIV test results."
693,HIV/AIDS,HIV prevention,"Although many researchers are working to develop one, there’s currently no vaccine available to prevent the transmission of HIV. However, taking certain steps can help prevent the transmission of HIV. The most common way for HIV to be transferred is through anal or vaginal sex without a condom or other barrier method. This risk can’t be completely eliminated unless sex is avoided entirely, but the risk can be lowered considerably by taking a few precautions. A person concerned about their risk for HIV should: Get tested for HIV.It’s important they learn their status and that of their partner. Get tested for other sexually transmitted infections (STIs).If they test positive for one, they should get it treated, because having an STI increases the risk of contracting HIV. Use condoms.They should learn the correct way to use condoms and use them every time they have sex, whether it’s through vaginal or anal intercourse. It’s important to keep in mind that pre-seminal fluids (which come out before male ejaculation) can contain HIV. Take their medications as directed if they have HIV.This lowers the risk of transmitting the virus to their sexual partner. Shop for condoms online. Other steps to help prevent the spread of HIV include: Avoid sharing needles or other paraphernalia.HIV is transmitted through blood and can be contracted by using materials that have come in contact with the blood of someone who has HIV. Consider PEP.A person who has been exposed to HIV should contact their healthcare provider about obtaining post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP). PEP can reduce the risk of contracting HIV. It consists of three antiretroviral medications given for 28 days. PEP should be started as soon as possible after exposure but before 36 to 72 hours have passed. Consider PrEP.A person has a higher chance of contracting HIV should talk to their healthcare provider aboutpre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). If taken consistently, it can lower the risk of acquiring HIV. PrEP is a combination of two drugs available in pill form. Healthcare providers can offer more information on these and other ways to prevent the spread of HIV. Check here for more information on STI prevention."
694,HIV/AIDS,Living with HIV: What to expect and tips for coping,"More than 1.2million peoplein the United States are living with HIV. It’s different for everybody, but with treatment, many can expect to live a long, productive life. The most important thing is to start antiretroviral treatment as soon as possible. By taking medications exactly as prescribed, people living with HIV can keep their viral load low and their immune system strong. It’s also important to follow up with a healthcare provider regularly. Other ways people living with HIV can improve their health include: Make their health their top priority.Steps to help people living with HIV feel their best include:fueling their body with a well-balanced dietexercising regularlygetting plenty of restavoiding tobacco and other drugsreporting any new symptoms to their healthcare provider right away fueling their body with a well-balanced diet exercising regularly getting plenty of rest avoiding tobacco and other drugs reporting any new symptoms to their healthcare provider right away Focus on their mental health.They could consider seeing a licensed therapist who is experienced in treating people with HIV. Use safer sex practices.Talk to their sexual partner(s). Get tested for other STIs. And use condoms and other barrier methods every time they have vaginal or anal sex. Talk to their healthcare provider about PrEP and PEP.When used consistently by a person without HIV, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) can lower the chances of transmission. PrEP is most often recommended for people without HIV in relationships with people with HIV, but it can be used in other situations as well. Online sources for finding a PrEP provider includePrEP LocatorandPleasePrEPMe. Surround themselves with loved ones.When first telling people about their diagnosis, they can start slow by telling someone who can maintain their confidence. They may want to choose someone who won’t judge them and who will support them in caring for their health. Get support.They can join an HIV support group, either in person or online, so they can meet with others who face the same concerns they have. Their healthcare provider can also steer them toward a variety of resources in their area. There are many ways to get the most out of life when living with HIV. Hear some real stories of people living with HIV."
695,HIV/AIDS,HIV life expectancy: Know the facts,"In the 1990s, a 20-year-old person with HIV had a19-year life expectancy. By 2011, a 20-year-old person with HIV could expect to live another 53 years. It’s a dramatic improvement, due in large part to antiretroviral therapy. With proper treatment, many people with HIV can expect a normal or near- normal lifespan. Of course, many things affect life expectancy for a person with HIV. Among them are: CD4 cell count viral load serious HIV-related illnesses, including hepatitis misusing drugs smoking access, adherence, and response to treatment other health conditions age Where a person lives also matters. People in the United States and other developed countries may be more likely to have access to antiretroviral therapy. Consistent use of these drugs helps prevent HIV from progressing to AIDS. When HIV advances to AIDS, life expectancy without treatment is about3 years. In 2017, about20.9 million peopleliving with HIV were using antiretroviral therapy. Life expectancy statistics are just general guidelines. People living with HIV should talk to their healthcare provider to learn more about what they can expect. Learn more about life expectancy and long-term outlook with HIV."
696,HIV/AIDS,Is there a vaccine for HIV?,"Currently, there are no vaccines to prevent or treat HIV. Research and testing on experimental vaccines are ongoing, but none are close to being approved for general use. HIV is a complicated virus. It mutates (changes) rapidly and is often able to fend off immune system responses. Only a small number of people who have HIV develop broadly neutralizing antibodies, the kind of antibodies that can respond to a range of HIV strains. The firstHIV vaccine efficacy studyin 7 years was underway in South Africa in 2016. The experimental vaccine is an updated version of one used in a 2009 trial that took place in Thailand. A 3.5-year follow-up after vaccination showed the vaccine was 31.2 percent effective in preventing HIV transmission. The study involves 5,400 men and women from South Africa. In 2016 in South Africa, about270,000 peoplecontracted HIV. The results of the study are expected in2021. Other late-stage, multinational vaccine clinical trials are alsocurrently underway. Other research into an HIV vaccine is also ongoing. While there’s still no vaccine to prevent HIV, people with HIV can benefit from other vaccines to prevent HIV-related illnesses. Here are the CDC recommendations: pneumonia:recommendedfor all children younger than 2 and all adults 65 and older influenza:recommendedfor all people over 6 months old annually with rare exceptions hepatitis A and B:ask your doctor if you should get vaccinated for hepatitis A and B, especially if you are in ahigher risk group meningitis:the meningococcal conjugate vaccination isrecommendedfor all preteens and teens at 11 to 12 years old with a booster dose at 16, or anyone at risk. The serogroup B meningococcal vaccination is recommended for anyone 10 years or older with increased risk. shingles:recommendedfor those ages 50 or older Learn why an HIV vaccine is so difficult to develop."
697,HIV/AIDS,HIV statistics,"Here are today’s HIV numbers: In 2019, about38 millionpeople worldwide were living with HIV. Of those, 1.8 million were children below the age 15 years. At the end of 2019,25.4 millionpeople living with HIV were using antiretroviral therapy. Since the pandemic began,75.7 millionpeople have contracted HIV, and AIDS-related complications have claimed 32.7 million lives. In 2019,690,000people died from AIDS-related diseases. This is a decline from 1.9 million in 2005. Eastern and Southern Africa are the hardest hit. In 2019,20.7 millionpeople in these areas were living with HIV, and 730,000 more contracted the virus. The region has more than half of all people living with HIV worldwide. Adult and adolescent women accounted for19 percentof new HIV diagnoses in the United States in 2018. Almost half of all new cases occur in African Americans. Left untreated, a woman with HIV has a15–45 percentchance of passing HIV to her baby during pregnancy or breastfeeding. With antiretroviral therapy throughout pregnancy and avoidance of breastfeeding, the risk is less than5 percent. In the 1990s, a 20-year-old person with HIV had alife expectancyof 19 years. By 2011, it had improved to 53 years. Today, life expectancy isnear normalif antiretroviral therapy is started soon after contracting HIV. As access to antiretroviral therapy continues to improve around the world, these statistics will hopefully keep changing. Learn more statistics about HIV."
698,Hives,Overview,"Hives typically occur as an allergic response to something in your environment or something you ate. But they may sometimes happen because of an underlying health issue. Hives, also known as urticaria, are itchy, raised welts that are found on the skin. They’re usually red, pink, or flesh colored on lighter skin and may be flesh colored or slightly lighter or darker than your skin tone onbrown or black skin. Sometimes they sting or hurt. In most cases, hives are caused by an allergic reaction to a medication or food or are a reaction to an irritant in the environment. In many cases, hives are an acute (temporary) problem that may be alleviated with allergy medications. Most rashes go away on their own. However, chronic (ongoing) cases, as well as hives accompanied by a severe allergic reaction, are larger medical concerns."
699,Hives,Pictures of hives,
700,Hives,What causes hives?,"Hives are usually caused by anallergic reactionto something that you have encountered or swallowed. When you have an allergic reaction, your body begins to release histamines into your blood. Histamines are chemicals your body produces in an attempt to defend itself against infection and other outside intruders. In some people, histamines can cause swelling, itching, and many of the symptoms that are experienced with hives. In terms of allergens, hives can becausedby factors such as pollen, medications, food, animal dander, and insect bites. Hives might also be caused by circumstances besides allergies. It’s not uncommon for people to experience hives as the result of stress, tight clothes, exercise, illnesses, or infections. It’s also possible to develop hives as the result of excessive exposure to hot or cold temperatures or from irritation due to excessive sweating. Because there are several potential triggers, many times the actual cause of hives can’t be determined."
701,Hives,Who is at risk?,"People who are known to have allergies are more likely to get hives. You may also be at risk of developing hives if you’re taking medication or if you’re unknowingly exposed to things you may be allergic to, such as food or pollen. If you’re already ill with an infection or a health condition, you may be more vulnerable to developing hives."
702,Hives,What do hives look like?,"The most noticeable symptom of hives is the welts that appear on the skin. Welts may be red but can also be the same color as your skin. They can be small and round, ring-shaped, or large and of random shape. Hives are itchy, and they tend to appear in batches on the affected part of the body. They can grow larger, change shape, and spread. Hives may disappear or reappear over the course of the outbreak. Individual hives welts can last anywhere fromhalf an hour to a day. Hives may turn white when pressed. Sometimes the hives may change shape or form together and create a larger, raised area. Hives can occur in a variety of places on the body. Call 911 or get medical attention immediately if you develop a hives outbreak around your throat or on your tongue or have trouble breathing along with hives."
703,Hives,Types of hives,"Hives can occur in response to an allergic reaction or may not have an identifiable cause. The most common causes of hives are allergic reactions. These can be caused by any allergen you might be sensitive to, including: foods (such as nuts, milk, and eggs) pet dander pollen dust mites insect bites or stings medications (primarily antibiotics, cancer drugs, or ibuprofen) Mild cases of hives caused by allergies are typically treated with long- or short-term allergy medications and avoidance of the trigger. Anaphylaxisis a severe, life threatening allergic reaction. In this condition, hives are oftenaccompanied bybreathing difficulties, nausea or vomiting, severe swelling, and dizziness. Call 911 or your local emergency services immediately if you suspect you’re experiencing anaphylaxis. Chronic hivesare ongoing cases that don’t necessarily have an identifiable cause. Also called chronic urticaria, this condition is marked by recurring hives that can interfere with your daily life. Chronic casescan lastbetween weeks to several months or years. You may suspect chronic hives if you have welts that don’t go away within 6 weeks. While not life threatening, this form of hives can be uncomfortable and difficult to treat. Chronic hives may also be a symptom of anunderlying health problem, such as: an autoimmune disorder celiac disease lupus type 1 diabetes rheumatoid arthritis thyroid disease This form of acute hives is considered mild. Excessive scratching or continuous pressure on the skin causes it.Dermatographismusually clears up on its own in a short period of time without treatment. Sometimes changes in temperature can induce hives in people who are sensitive to such changes. Cold-induced hives may occur from cold water or air exposure, while body heat from physical activity may cause exercise-induced hives. Exposure to sunlight or tanning beds may also bring about solar hives in some people. Bothviral and bacterial infectionscan cause hives. Common bacterial infections causing hives include urinary tract infections and strep throat. Viruses that causeinfectious mononucleosis (mono),hepatitis, and colds often cause hives."
704,Hives,Finding relief: Treatment options,"The first step in getting treatment is to figure out if you actually have hives. In most cases, a doctor will be able to determine if you have hives from a physical exam. Your skin will show signs of the welts that are linked with hives. A doctor may also perform blood tests or skin tests to find out what may have caused your hives — especially if your hives were the result of an allergic reaction. You may not need prescription treatment if you’re experiencing a mild case of hives not related to allergies or other health conditions. In these circumstances, a doctor might suggest that you find temporary relief by: taking antihistamines, such asdiphenhydramine(Benadryl) orcetirizine(Zyrtec) avoiding irritating the area avoiding hot water, which may aggravate the hives taking a cool or lukewarm bath withcolloidal oatmealor baking soda Anaphylaxis is a medical emergency that needs to be treated immediately by a physician. If you think you may be experiencing anaphylaxis, contact 911 or your local emergency services."
705,Hives,Can hives be prevented?,"Simple changes to your lifestyle may be able to help you prevent hives from reoccurring in the future. If you have allergies and you know which substances are likely to cause an allergic reaction, a doctor will suggest that you avoid any possible exposure to these factors. Allergy shots are another option that may help you reduce the risk of experiencing hives again. Avoid being in high humidity areas or wearing tight clothing if you have recently had a hives outbreak."
706,Hives,Frequently asked questions,"Below are some of the most commonly asked questions about hives. No, hives are not contagious and can’t spread from one person to another. In many cases, hives are the result of an allergic reaction to something you have been exposed to, such as certain medications or pollen. It could also be caused by an infection, stress, or wearing clothes that are too tight. If you have hives that persist for more than a few days, contact a doctor to see if an allergy test is needed to determine the cause of your symptoms. A hives outbreak can last anywhere fromseveral hourstoup to a week or two. If the hives are the result of an allergic reaction, they may last longer and require medical treatment. In some cases, chronic hives can last formonths or even years. Talk with a doctor if you experience hives that don’t go away on their own. Yes, there are several home remedies that may help alleviate the symptoms of hives. Taking an antihistamine is one option, as well as taking a cool or lukewarm bath with colloidal oatmeal or baking soda. Avoid hot water, as this may aggravate the hives. Also, try to avoid any potential irritants or allergens that may have caused the hives in the first place."
707,Hives,What to expect,"Although hives can be itchy and uncomfortable, usually they’re not severe and will disappear after a period of time. However, be aware that as some hives go away, new ones may pop up. Mild cases of hives are considered harmless. Hives can be dangerous if you are having a serious allergic reaction and your throat is swelling. Prompt treatment for a severe case of hives is important for a good outlook."
708,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),Overview,"HPV is the most common STI in the world, however, vaccines are available to prevent it. What is human papillomavirus infection? Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a viral infection that’s passed between people through skin-to-skin contact. There are over 100 varieties of HPV,more than 40of which are passed through sexual contact and can affect your genitals,mouth, or throat. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), HPV is the most commonsexually transmitted infection (STI). It’s so common that most sexually active people will get some variety of it at some point, even if they have few sexual partners. Some cases of genital HPV infection may not cause any health problems. However, some types of HPV can lead to the development ofgenital wartsand even cancers of the cervix, anus, and throat."
709,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),HPV causes,"The virus that causes HPV infection is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Most people get a genital HPV infection through direct sexual contact, including vaginal, anal, and oral sex. Because HPV is a skin-to-skin infection, intercourse isn’t required for transmission to occur. Many people have HPV and don’t even know it, which means you can still contract it even if your partner doesn’t have any symptoms. It’s also possible to have multipletypes of HPV. In rare cases, a mother who has HPV can transmit the virus to herbaby during delivery. When this happens, the child may develop a condition called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis where they develop HPV-related warts inside their throat or airways."
710,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),HPV symptoms,"Often, HPV infection doesn’t cause any noticeable symptoms or health problems. In fact,90 percentof HPV infections (9 out of 10) go away on their own within two years, according to the CDC. However, because the virus is still in a person’s body during this time, that person may unknowingly transmit HPV. When the virus doesn’t go away on its own, it can cause serious health problems. These includegenital wartsand warts in the throat (known as recurrent respiratory papillomatosis). HPV can also causecervical cancerand other cancers of the genitals, head, neck, andthroat. The types of HPV that cause warts are different from the types that cause cancer. So, having genital warts caused by HPV doesn’t mean that you’ll develop cancer. Cancers caused by HPV often don’t show symptoms until the cancer is in later stages of growth.Regular screeningscan help diagnose HPV-related health problems earlier. This can improve outlook and increase chances of survival. Learn more about HPV symptoms and infection."
711,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),HPV in men,"Manymen who contract an HPV infectionhave no symptoms, although some may develop genital warts. See your doctor if you notice any unusual bumps or lesions on your penis, scrotum, or anus. Some strains of HPV can cause penile, anal, and throat cancer in men. Some men may be more at risk for developing HPV-related cancers, including men who receive anal sex and men with a weakened immune system. The strains of HPV that cause genital warts aren’t the same as those that cause cancer.Get more information about HPV infection in men."
712,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),HPV in women,"It’s estimated that80 percentof women will contract at least one type of HPV during their lifetime. Like with men, many women that get HPV don’t have any symptoms and the infection goes away without causing any health problems. Some women may notice that they have genital warts, which can appear inside the vagina, in or around the anus, and on the cervix or vulva. Make an appointment with your doctor if you notice any unexplained bumps or growths in or around your genital area. Some strains of HPV can cause cervical cancer or cancers of the vagina, anus, or throat. Regular screening can help detect the changes associated with cervical cancer in women. Additionally, DNA tests on cervical cells can detect strains of HPV associated with genital cancers."
713,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),HPV tests,"Testing for HPV is different in men and women. Updated guidelinesfrom the US Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommend that women have their first Pap test, orPap smear, at age 21, regardless of onset of sexual activity. Regular Pap tests help to identify abnormal cells in women. These can signal cervical cancer or other HPV-related problems. Women ages 21 to 29 should have just a Pap test every three years. From ages 30 to 65, women should do one of the following: receive a Pap test every three years receive an HPV test every five years; it will screen for high-risk types of HPV (hrHPV) receive both tests together every five years; this is known as co-testing Standalone tests are preferred over co-testing, according to the USPSTF. If you’re younger than age 30, your doctor or gynecologist may also request an HPV test if your Pap results are abnormal. There areat least 14 strainsof HPV that can lead to cancer. If you have one of these strains, your doctor may want to monitor you for cervical changes. You may need to get a Pap test more frequently. Your doctor may also request a follow-up procedure, such as acolposcopy. Cervical changes that lead to cancer often take many years to develop, and HPV infections often go away on their own without causing cancer. You may want to follow a course of watchful waiting instead of undergoing treatment for abnormal or precancerous cells. It’s important to note that the HPV DNA test is only available for diagnosing HPV in women. There’s currently no FDA-approved test available for diagnosing HPV in men. According to theCDC, routine screening for anal, throat, or penile cancer in men isn’t currently recommended. Some doctors may perform an anal Pap test for men that have an increased risk for developinganal cancer. This includes men who receive anal sex and men withHIV."
714,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),HPV treatments,"Most cases of HPV go away on their own, so there’s no treatment for the infection itself. Instead, your doctor will likely want to have you come in for repeat testing in a year to see if the HPV infection persists and if any cell changes have developed that need further follow-up. Genital warts can be treated with prescription medications,burningwith an electrical current, orfreezingwith liquid nitrogen. But, getting rid of the physical warts doesn’t treat the virus itself, and the warts may return. Precancerous cells may be removed through a short procedure that’s performed at your doctor’s office. Cancers that develop from HPV may be treated by methods such aschemotherapy,radiation therapy, or surgery. Sometimes, multiple methods may be used. There currently aren’t any medically-supported natural treatments available for HPV infection. Routine screening for HPV and cervical cancer is important for identifying, monitoring, and treating health problems that may result from HPV infection.Explore the treatment options for HPV."
715,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),How can you get HPV?,"Anyone who’s had sexual skin-to-skin contact is at risk for HPV infection. Other factors that may put someone at an increased risk for HPV infection include: increased number of sexual partners unprotected vaginal, oral, or anal sex a weakened immune system having a sexual partner that has HPV If you contract a high-risk type of HPV, some factors can make it more likely that the infection will continue and may develop into cancer: a weakened immune system having other STIs, such asgonorrhea,chlamydia, andherpes simplex chronic inflammation having many children (cervical cancer) using oral contraceptives over a long period of time (cervical cancer) using tobacco products (mouth or throat cancer) receiving anal sex (anal cancer)"
716,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),HPV prevention,"The easiest ways to prevent HPV are to usecondomsand topractice safe sex. In addition, theGardasil 9 vaccineis available for the prevention of genital warts and cancers caused by HPV. The vaccine can protect against nine types of HPV known to be associated with either cancer or genital warts. The CDC recommends the HPV vaccine for boys and girls ages 11 or 12. Two doses of the vaccine are given at least six months apart. Women and men ages 15 to 26 can also get vaccinated on a three-dose schedule. Additionally, people between the ages of 27 and 45 who haven’t been previously vaccinated for HPV arenow eligiblefor vaccination with Gardasil 9. To prevent health problems associated with HPV, be sure to get regular health checkups, screenings, and Pap smears.Read on to learn more about the pros and cons of HPV vaccination."
717,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),HPV and pregnancy,"Contracting HPV doesn’t decrease your chances of becoming pregnant. If you’re pregnant and have HPV, you may wish to delay treatment until after delivery. However, in some cases, HPV infection can cause complications. Hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy may cause genital warts to grow and in some cases, these warts may bleed. If genital warts are widespread, they may make a vaginal delivery difficult. When genital warts block the birth canal, aC-sectionmay be required. In rare cases, a woman with HPV can pass it on to her baby. When this happens, a rare but serious condition called recurrent respiratory papillomatosis may occur. In this condition, children develop HPV-related growths in their airways. Cervical changes can still occur during pregnancy, so you should plan to continue routine screening for cervical cancer and HPV while you’re pregnant.Discover more about HPV and pregnancy."
718,Human Papillomavirus (HPV),HPV facts and statistics,"Here are some additional facts and statistics about HPV infection: The CDC estimates that79 millionAmericans have HPV. Most of these people are in their late teens or early 20s. It’s estimated that about14 millionpeople will newly contract HPV each year. In the United States, HPV causesover 33,000cancers each year in men and women. It’s estimated that95 percentof anal cancers are caused by HPV infection. Most of these cases are caused by one type of HPV: HPV 16. Two strains of HPV — HPV 16 and 18 — account for at least70 percentof cervical cancer cases. Vaccination can protect against contracting these strains. In 2006 the first HPV vaccination was recommended. Since then, a64 percentreduction in vaccine-covered HPV strains has been observed in teenage girls in the United States."
719,Hypertension,Overview,"Hypertension occurs when the force of blood pushing through your vessels is consistently too high. Nearly half of the adults in America have high blood pressure. Blood pressure readings consist of two numbers: systolic pressure (top number), which measures pressure when your heart beats, and diastolic pressure (bottom number), which measures pressure between beats. Hypertension treatment involves medications, such as beta-blockers, diuretics, ACE inhibitors, and lifestyle changes. While it may not be cured, it can be managed effectively. Your blood pressure measurement takes into account the amount of blood passing through your blood vessels and the amount of resistance the blood meets while the heart is pumping. High blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when the force of blood pushing through your vessels is consistently too high. In this article, we’ll cover the basics of hypertension, including its symptoms, causes, how it’s treated, and more."
720,Hypertension,What is high blood pressure?,"Narrowarteriescreate more resistance for blood flow out of the heart. The narrower your arteries, the more resistance there is, and the higher your blood pressure will be. Over the long term, the increased pressure can cause health issues, includingheart disease. Hypertension is quite common. Sinceguidelineschanged in 2017,nearly halfof American adults have high blood pressure, according to the American Heart Association. Hypertension typically develops over several years, usually without causing any symptoms. But even without symptoms, high blood pressure can cause damage to your blood vessels and organs, especially the brain, heart, eyes, and kidneys. Early detection is important. Regular blood pressure readings can help you and a doctor notice any changes. If your blood pressure is elevated, a doctor may have youcheck your blood pressureover a few weeks to see if the number stays elevated or falls back to typical levels. Treatment for hypertension includes both prescription medication and healthy lifestyle changes. Without treatment, it could lead to health issues, including heart attack and stroke."
721,Hypertension,How to understand high blood pressure readings,"Yourblood pressure readingconsists oftwo numbers: Systolic pressure (top number):the pressure in your arteries when your heart beats and pumps out blood Diastolic pressure (bottom number):the pressure in your arteries between beats of your heart Five categoriesdefine blood pressure readings for adults: Healthy:A healthy blood pressure reading is a systolic pressure of less than 120 millimeters of mercury (mm Hg) and a diastolic pressure of less than 80 mm Hg. This is typically written as 120/80 or spoken as “120 over 80.” Elevated:The systolic number is between 120 and 129 mm Hg, and the diastolic number is less than 80 mm Hg. Doctors usually don’t treat elevated blood pressure with medication. Instead, they may encourage lifestyle changes to help lower your numbers. Stage 1 hypertension:The systolic number is between 130 and 139 mm Hg, or the diastolic number is between 80 and 89 mm Hg. Stage 2 hypertension:The systolic number is 140 mm Hg or higher, or the diastolic number is 90 mm Hg or higher. Hypertensive crisis:The systolic number is over 180 mm Hg, or the diastolic number is over 120 mm Hg. Blood pressure in this range requiresurgent medical attention. If symptoms, such as chest pain, headache, shortness of breath, or visual changes occur when blood pressure is this high, medical care in an emergency department is needed. A blood pressure reading is taken with a pressure cuff. It’s important to have a cuff that fits for an accurate reading. An ill-fitting cuff may deliver inaccurate readings. Blood pressure readings are different forchildren and teenagers. Ask your child’s doctor for the healthy ranges for your child if you need to monitor their blood pressure."
722,Hypertension,What causes high blood pressure?,"There are two types of hypertension. Each type has a different cause. Essential hypertension, also called primary hypertension, develops over time.Most peoplehave this type of high blood pressure. Acombination of factorstypically play a role in the development of essential hypertension: Genes:Some people aregenetically predisposedto hypertension. This may be from gene mutations or inherited from your parents. Age:Peopleover 65 years oldare more at risk for hypertension. Race:Black peoplehave a higher incidence of hypertension in the United States.Researchsuggests that systemic, cultural, and genetic factors contribute to this inequity. Living with obesity:Living withobesitycan lead to a few cardiovascular issues, including hypertension. High alcohol consumption:Researchshows that even one drink per day can increase your risk of hypertension, with higher alcohol consumption further increasing your risk. Living a sedentary lifestyle:Sedentary behaviorshave links to several cardiovascular issues, including hypertension. Living with diabetes or metabolic syndrome:People diagnosed with eitherdiabetesormetabolic syndromeare at a higher risk of developing hypertension. High sodium intake: There’s aclose linkbetween daily highsodium intake(more than 5 grams a day) and hypertension. Secondary hypertensionoften occurs quickly and can become more severe than primary hypertension. Severalconditionsthat may cause secondary hypertension include: kidney disease obstructive sleep apnea structural heart issues present from birth problems with your thyroid adrenal glandproblems certain endocrine tumors Secondary hypertension may also be a side effect ofcertain medications."
723,Hypertension,What are the symptoms of hypertension?,"Hypertension is generally a silent condition. Many people won’t experience any symptoms. It may take years or even decades for the condition to reach levels severe enough that symptoms become apparent. Even then, some people may attribute these symptoms to other causes. Getting regular blood pressure readings is the best way to know if you have hypertension. Most doctors’ offices take a blood pressure reading at every appointment. Symptoms of severe hypertension, such as in a hypertensive crisis, caninclude: headaches nausea vomiting visual disturbances chest or back pain difficulty breathing Read more:“Symptoms of High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)”"
724,Hypertension,What are the effects of high blood pressure on the body?,"Because hypertension is often a silent condition, it can cause damage to your body for years before symptoms become obvious. Without treatment, you may face serious, even fatal, complications. Hypertension can damage your arteries, making them tougher, tighter, and less elastic. This damage makes it easier for deposits to collect in your arteries and restrict blood flow through your body, affecting multiple systems. Complications of hypertensioninclude: stroke heart attack heart failure arrhythmia sudden cardiac death kidney disease or failure vision loss sexual dysfunction cognitive issues, includingdementia Read more:“The Effects of Hypertension on the Body” People with hypertension may be more likely to experience challenges during pregnancy or childbirth,including: decreased kidney function preeclampsia low birth weight Some people may develop hypertension during pregnancy. This often resolves once the baby is born. However, developing hypertension during pregnancy mayincrease your riskof developing hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions later in life. Read more:“Controlling Blood Pressure in Preeclampsia”"
725,Hypertension,How is high blood pressure diagnosed?,"Diagnosing hypertension is as simple as taking a blood pressure reading. Most doctors’ offices check blood pressure as part of a routine visit. If you don’t receive a blood pressure reading at your next appointment, feel free to request one. If your blood pressure is elevated, a doctor may request more readings over the course of a few days or weeks. Doctors rarely diagnose hypertension after just one reading. They’ll need to see evidence of a sustained problem. That’s because your environment can contribute to increased blood pressure, like the stress you may feel by being at the doctor’s office (known as “white coat syndrome”). Also, blood pressure levelschange throughout the day. If your blood pressure remains high, a doctor will likely conduct more tests to rule out underlying conditions. These tests can include: cholesterol screeningand other blood tests test of your heart’s electrical activity with anelectrocardiogram(EKG, sometimes referred to as an ECG) ultrasoundof your heart or kidneys home blood pressure monitorto monitor your blood pressure over a 24-hour period at home"
726,Hypertension,What are the treatment options for high blood pressure?,"If a doctor diagnoses you with primary hypertension, lifestyle changes may help reduce your high blood pressure. If lifestyle changes alone aren’t enough, or if they stop being effective, they may prescribe medication. Many people go through a trial-and-error phase with blood pressure medications. A doctor may need to try different medications until they find one or a combination that works for you. Some of the medications used to treat hypertension include: beta-blockers diuretics, aka water pills angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) calcium channel blockers alpha-2 agonists Read more:“11 Common Blood Pressure Medications” If a doctor discovers an underlying issue causing your hypertension, treatment will focus on that other condition. For example, if a medication you’ve started taking is causing increased blood pressure, your doctor will try other medications that don’t have this side effect. Sometimes, hypertension is persistent despite treatment for the underlying cause. In this case, a doctor may work with you to develop lifestyle changes and prescribe medications to help reduce your blood pressure. Treatment plans for hypertension often evolve. What worked at first may become less useful over time. Your doctor will continue to work with you to refine your treatment."
727,Hypertension,Home remedies for high blood pressure,"Healthy lifestyle changes can help you control the factors that cause hypertension. Experts recommend the following: consuming aheart-healthy diet, emphasizing fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins like fish increasing physical activity, aiming for150 minutesof moderate activity each week maintaining amoderate weight managing stress quitting smokingif you do limiting alcohol consumption Read more:“7 Home Remedies for Managing High Blood Pressure”"
728,Hypertension,Lifestyle tips to lower your risk of hypertension,"If you have risk factors for hypertension, you can take steps now to lower your risk for the condition and its complications, such as: eating4 servings of fruit and 5 servings of vegetableseach day limiting the amount of refined sugar you consume reducing your daily sodium intake to1.5 to 2.3 grams setting weight loss goalsif you have overweight or obesity monitoring your blood pressure regularly Read more:“12 Causes of High Blood Pressure (and How to Prevent It)”"
729,Hypertension,Takeaway,"High blood pressure, also known as hypertension, is a common health issue in the United States. Treatment for hypertension varies depending on factors such as the severity of your condition and which medications a doctor thinks will work best for you. In many cases of hypertension, lifestyle changes can be powerful tools for managing — or even reversing — high blood pressure. These changes include incorporating more nutritious fruits and vegetables into your diet, getting more physical activity, limiting your sodium intake, and limiting your alcohol consumption. Because hypertension often presents with no symptoms, checking your blood pressure regularly is important. Severe hypertension can cause serious health issues, so the sooner you receive a diagnosis, the sooner you can begin to manage it."
730,Hyperthyroidism,Overview,"Hyperthyroidism occurs when the thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, leading to symptoms like weight loss, rapid heartbeat, and anxiety. Several conditions can cause hyperthyroidism, with Graves’ disease being the most common. If left untreated, it can lead to complications like thyroid storm, osteoporosis, and pregnancy issues. Hyperthyroidism is diagnosed through physical exams and lab tests, and treatment options include medication, radioactive iodine, and surgery. Several health conditions can lead to hyperthyroidism, most commonlyGraves’ disease. The thyroid is a small, butterfly-shaped gland located at the front of your neck. It produces thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), which are two primary hormones that control how your cells use energy. Your thyroid gland regulates your metabolism through the release of these hormones. When yourthyroidmakes too much T3, T4, or both, itspeeds upyour body’s systems, causing distress. Timely diagnosis and treatment of hyperthyroidism can relieve symptoms and prevent complications."
731,Hyperthyroidism,What are the symptoms of hyperthyroidism?,"Some symptoms of hyperthyroidism may be physically obvious, while others are subtle, and may be hard to notice at first. Sometimes hyperthyroidism is mistaken foranxiety. According to theNational Institutes of Health (NIH), hallmark signs and symptoms of hyperthyroidism include: weight loss, but with an increased appetite rapid or irregular heartbeat feeling nervous or irritable feeling fatigued, but having trouble sleeping hand tremors, muscle weakness getting easily overheated frequent bowel movements The thyroid gland itself can swell into agoiter, which can be either symmetrical or one-sided. A goiter is an enlargement of the gland, and it’s often visible as a bulge or puffiness at the base of your neck. Themost common causeof a goiter is iodine deficiency. You may also experienceprominent or bulging eyes. This is medically known as exophthalmos, and it’s associated with Graves’ disease. Longterm and untreated thyroid disease can also causebrittle hair, and hair loss."
732,Hyperthyroidism,Complications,"Untreated, hyperthyroidism can contribute to an increased risk of: Thyroid storm:Athyroid stormis a rare health condition that occurs as a result of untreated hyperthyroidism. Your body enters overdrive as a result of too many thyroid hormones in its system. A thyroid storm is a potentially life threatening combination of symptoms, including rapid heart rate, high blood pressure, and fever. Pregnancy complications:This includes people with existing thyroid disorders and people who develop hyperthyroidism during pregnancy. High thyroid hormone levels can harm both pregnant people and the fetus. Risks includemiscarriage and premature birth. Testing thyroid hormone levels during pregnancy can detect hyperthyroidism. The doctor will determine the need for treatment based on the levels. Osteoporosis: Hyperthyroidism can cause your bones to become weak and thin, which can lead toosteoporosis. Taking vitamin D and calcium supplements during and after treatment can help improve bone health. Gettingadequate exercise or daily physical activityin addition to hyperthyroidism treatment also helps prevent osteoporosis. Cancer: Some types of cancer can present with hyperthyroidism.A 2018 researchoverview reported that thyroid cancer in hyperthyroid patients was more “aggressive” and had a worse outlook than in euthyroid patients (those with a healthy thyroid)."
733,Hyperthyroidism,What causes hyperthyroidism?,"A variety of conditions can cause hyperthyroidism. Graves’ disease, anautoimmune disorder, is the most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves’ disease, your immune systemattacks your thyroid glandwith antibodies, resulting in the release of too much hormone. Tell your doctor if any relatives have been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism, so they can get an accurate picture of your risk factors. Aside from Graves’ disease,other causesof hyperthyroidism include: excessiodine thyroiditis (inflammation of the thyroid) toxic thyroid nodules (toxic adenoma) tumors of the ovaries or testes"
734,Hyperthyroidism,Vs. Thyrotoxicosis,"Thyrotoxicosis and hyperthyroidism don’t mean the same thing, even though they’re sometimes used interchangeably. Hyperthyroidism (and its many forms) are actually all under the umbrella of thyrotoxicosis. Hyperthyroidism refers to your thyroid’s physical overproduction of hormones. Thyrotoxicosis refers more broadly to the presence oftoo much thyroid hormonein your body, regardless of whether it came from the gland, medication, or other cause."
735,Hyperthyroidism,How do doctors diagnose hyperthyroidism?,"In evaluating you for hyperthyroidism, a doctor will collect your personal and family medical history, and conduct a physical exam. Doctors usually diagnose hyperthyroidism based on symptoms, clinical signs, and lab tests. Thesediagnostic testsinclude: T4, free T4, and T3 level test thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH)level test thyroid scan(radioactive iodine uptake scan) ultrasoundof thyroid CTor MRI scans thyroid antibodies While primary care doctors can order some of these tests, it’s best to see an endocrinologist. Endocrinologists specialize in treating and managing hormone-related health conditions."
736,Hyperthyroidism,How to treat hyperthyroidism,"Medication:Anti-thyroid medications prevent the thyroid from making hormones. The most common anti-thyroid medications are a class called thionamides, which includes the drugsmethimazole(MMI)andpropylthiouracil(PTU). Radioactive iodine:Radioactive iodine (RAI), also just called radioiodine,effectively destroysthe cells that produce thyroid hormones without damaging other bodily tissues. It is usually taken as an oral tablet or liquid. Most people who receive radioiodine treatment for hyperthyroidism develop the opposite condition, hypothyroidism. However, this is easier to treat, and you’ll take a daily thyroid hormone supplement. RAI is also used in higher doses to treat thyroid cancer. Surgery:During athyroidectomy, all or part of your thyroid gland is removed. This surgery may be recommended for certain people with hyperthyroidism, but it’s evaluated on an individual basis. Certain brands and strengths of medication for hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid)have been recalled. This is due to the medication having a less active drug (levothyroxine) than they are supposed to. You can search all FDA recalls and safety alerts here. Taking recalled tablets can lead to symptoms of hypothyroidism, such as fatigue, constipation, hair loss, and depression. Reduced effectiveness can be particularly dangerous for older people and those who are pregnant. Call your pharmacist to find out if your medication has been recalled. Don’t stop taking the medication unless advised to do so by your healthcare professional."
737,Hyperthyroidism,Risk factors,"To summarize, themain risk factorsfor hyperthyroidism are: Sex:Females are much more likely to have hyperthyroidism than males. Experts believe this may have to do with hormones. Pregnancy:Pregnancy can stimulate hyperthyroidism in some people, which can cause complications for both parent and fetus. Age:You’re considered at higher risk for hyperthyroidism as an older adult, especially after age 60. Genetics:A family history of hyperthyroidism usually indicates an increased likelihood of developing the condition. Iodine exposure:You may get too much iodine from certain medications or foods. Having another health condition:People with type 1 diabetes, primary adrenal insufficiency, or pernicious anemia are considered more at risk."
738,Hyperthyroidism,Takeaway,"There are many reasons your thyroid might start overproducing thyroid hormones. A genetic predisposition to thyroid conditions like Graves’ disease, having too much iodine in your system, or being pregnant can all contribute to hyperthyroidism. Eating well, exercising, and avoiding smoking can all help reduce your risk. Hyperthyroidism is diagnosed based on symptoms, blood tests, and imaging. It is treated primarily with medication, radioiodine therapy, and if necessary, surgery to remove all or part of the thyroid gland. Talk with your doctor if you believe you’re experiencing thyroid-related health concerns. You may be referred to an endocrinologist, who will evaluate you, and conduct the necessary tests."
739,Hypotension,Overview,"Hypotension, or low blood pressure, is defined as a reading lower than 90/60 and can be categorized into types like orthostatic, postprandial, neurally mediated, and severe, each with different causes and triggers. While low blood pressure doesn’t always have symptoms, it can indicate that vital organs aren’t receiving enough blood flow, leading to fatigue, dizziness, nausea, and in severe cases, shock, which requires immediate medical attention. Managing hypotension includes lifestyle adjustments like staying hydrated, managing emotional triggers, moving around to prevent blood pressure drops when standing, and medical treatments such as medications for underlying conditions or to raise blood pressure. Your blood pushes against your arteries with every heartbeat. The force of blood pushing against your artery walls is called blood pressure. Blood pressure goes up and down in response to your regular activities, such as sleeping and moving around. The medical term for low blood pressure is hypotension."
740,Hypotension,What is hypotension?,"Blood pressureis made up of two measurements: when your heart beats, and in the periods of rest between heartbeats. Systolic pressure(or systole) is the measurement of your blood pumping through your arteries when the ventricles of the heart squeeze. It supplies your body with blood. Diastolic pressure(or diastole) is the measurement for the periods of rest. It supplies your heart with blood by filling the coronary arteries. Your blood pressure reading is made up of two numbers: first the systolic measure, then the diastolic measure. Having a lower blood pressure is good in most cases (less than 120/80). But low blood pressure can sometimes make you feel tired or dizzy. In those cases, hypotension can be a sign of an underlying condition that should be treated. Hypotension in adults is defined as a blood pressure reading of lower than90/60."
741,Hypotension,Types of hypotension,"There are several types of hypotension. Low blood pressure is categorized according to when it happens and what’s causing it. Orthostatic hypotension(also called postural hypotension) is the drop in blood pressure that occurs when you move from sitting or lying down to standing. As your body adjusts to the position change, you may feel dizzy or lightheaded. This is what some people refer to as “seeing stars” when they get up. It can affect people of all ages, but it’s especially common in older adults. Aging andpregnancycan also cause an overall lowering of blood pressure. Conditions affecting the autonomic nervous system, such asParkinson’s diseaseanddiabetes, can often lead to orthostatic hypotension. This form of low blood pressure affects30% to 50%of people with Parkinson’s disease, and about30%of people with diabetes. Postprandial hypotensionis a drop in blood pressure that occurs after eating. Low blood pressure after eating iscommonin older adults and people withautonomic dysfunction. Blood pressure is a balancing act between your nervous system and other bodily systems (like your hormones and organs). Neurally mediated hypotension happens when there is an abnormal reflex interaction between the heart and the brain. Causes of neurally mediated hypotension include: standing in one position for a long time (children experience this form of hypotension more often than adults) having a strong emotional response, such as shock or fear (some people experience low blood pressure during medical or dental procedures for this reason) A severe drop in blood pressure can occur duringshock. Shock can happen if you experience a serious injury or infection. During shock, your organs do not get the blood and oxygen they need to function properly. Severe hypotension can be life threatening if not treated quickly. Having low blood pressure all the time can be a side effect of some medications. For example, medications used to treathigh blood pressurecan sometimes cause hypotension. Other conditions affecting the heart, nerves, liver, or hormone systems can also cause an overall lowering of blood pressure.Vitamin deficienciescan also contribute to lower blood pressure."
742,Hypotension,What causes hypotension?,"Everyone’s blood pressure drops at one time or another. Your body’s internal regulation of blood flow can sometimes cause you to have lower-than-normal blood pressure. Some people have low blood pressure all the time, without symptoms. The cause of this type of hypotension is unknown. A sudden decrease in blood pressure can happen after certain events like: standing up quickly eating a meal feeling suddenly afraid or experiencing a shocking event Certain conditions can cause long periods of hypotension that can become dangerous if left untreated. These conditions include: pregnancy, due to an increase in demand for blood from both the pregnant person and the growing fetus impaired circulation caused by aheart attackor heart condition dehydration, for example if you’revomitingand can’t keep liquids down, or have severediarrhea endocrine disorders, such asdiabetes, adrenal insufficiency, and thyroid disease autonomic dysfunction, damage to the nerves that control some bodily functions prolonged bed rest shock, a serious condition in which your vital organs aren’t getting enough oxygen anaphylactic shock, a severe form of allergic reaction large amounts of blood loss through injury blood infections Medications might also cause your blood pressure to become too low. Beta-blockersandnitroglycerin, used to treatheart disease, can have this effect. Diuretics,tricyclic antidepressants, anderectile dysfunction drugscan also cause hypotension. If a medication you’re taking causes your blood pressure to become too low, your doctor may adjust the dosage or change the medication. This usually improves the hypotension."
743,Hypotension,Hypotension symptoms,"Hypotension doesn’t always cause symptoms. But sometimes low blood pressure means your vital organs aren’t receiving as much blood flow as they need. If this happens, you might feel tired or unwell. Symptoms of hypotension may include: fatigue, an all-around sense of tiredness or lacking energy lightheadedness, or feeling like you might faint dizziness, feeling off-balance when you get up from a reclined or seated position, or while you’re standing nausea, a sense of discomfort in your stomach and feeling like you want to vomit clammy skin, when you feel damp or sweaty to the touch depression, persistent feelings like sadness or low mood that interfere with your daily activities loss of consciousness, also known as fainting or syncope blurry vision, when your eyesight is out-of-focus or hazy"
744,Hypotension,Treatment for hypotension,"Your treatment plan will depend on what’s causing your hypotension. Your doctor will consider factors including the type of hypotension you’re experiencing and the situations that may be causing hypotension for you. For some people, low blood pressure may not cause any symptoms. In cases where treatment is needed, a doctor may recommend lifestyle changes, medical treatment, or a combination of both. Sometimes changing certain habits can improve your low blood pressure. The causes of hypotension are different for different people, so your care plan probably won’t include all of these changes. Depending on the specifics of your situation, your doctor might suggest that you: Drink plenty of water to avoid hypotension due to dehydration, especially if you are vomiting or have diarrhea. Stay well hydrated during exercise and when you’re in a hot location. In some cases, your doctor may recommend increasing yourelectrolyteintake to help keep your blood pressure higher. Make note of the situations where you felt very scared or emotional right before a drop in your blood pressure. You may be able to plan ahead to avoid those situations. Or, you can plan for support in case you become dizzy or feel unwell. If you usually experience low blood pressure when you visit the doctor or dentist, you might consider telling them. If you experience low blood pressure when standing for long periods, try flexing your leg muscles and moving in place. If you have the option, take a break to sit down. Change positions slowly and gradually. Instead of standing up quickly, work your way into a sitting or standing position using small movements. Slow, deep breathing may help keep your blood pressure up. If you experience low blood pressure after eating, your doctor might suggest eating smaller meals more often throughout the day, or eating different foods. Avoid standing up suddenly after eating. There are many ways to manage low blood pressure in your daily life. Your doctor may make other lifestyle suggestions based on your needs. Some forms of hypotension may require medical treatment. Medical treatment for low blood pressure can include: Medication for an underlying condition:When an underlying condition is causing low blood pressure, your treatment may include medication for that condition. Your doctor may recommend medication for conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, or infection. Medication to raise blood pressure:Sometimes, your doctor will prescribe daily medication to raise severely low blood pressure. This is more likely in cases of severe orthostatic hypotension when other treatments have not helped. Emergency treatment for shock:Shock-induced hypotension is the most serious form of low blood pressure. Dangerously low blood pressure must be treated immediately. Emergency personnel may give you fluids and other treatments to increase your blood pressure and stabilize your vital signs."
745,Hypotension,Complications,"Hypotension isn’t always a sign of a larger health problem, and it may be treated easily. But for some people, low blood pressure requires treatment to prevent possible complications. Some complications of hypotension are: A sudden drop in blood pressure may make you feel dizzy, lightheaded, or even lose consciousness (faint). These symptoms can come on quickly, causing falls or other injuries. Fallsare a major cause of hospitalization for older adults. Older adults are more likely to experience hypotension after standing up or eating. Treatment and lifestyle changes can help you manage hypotension symptoms. If your blood pressure falls dangerously low, your vital organs can start to malfunction because they aren’t receiving enough blood to work properly. This can cause you to go into shock.Symptoms of shockinclude: cool, clammy skin a fast or irregular heartbeat rapid breathing Shock is a medical emergency. If you think you or someone else is experiencing shock, call 911 or your local emergency services."
746,Hypotension,Outlook,"Many people can manage low blood pressure by understanding the condition and its symptoms. Learn your triggers, if you have them, and how to manage them. If low blood pressure is making you feel unwell, your doctor may recommend lifestyle changes or medical treatment. If you’re prescribed medication, take it as directed to increase your blood pressure and avoid potentially harmful complications. It’s always best to notify your doctor if you’re concerned about your blood pressure levels and any symptoms you have."
747,Hypothyroidism,Overview,"Hypothyroidism occurs when the thyroid doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones, often causing symptoms like weight gain and fatigue. The most common causes of hypothyroidism are Hashimoto’s thyroiditis, radioactive iodine treatment, thyroid surgery, radiation therapy, medication side effects, and iodine deficiency. Hypothyroidism is best treated with levothyroxine (Levoxyl, Synthroid). This synthetic version copies the action of the natural T4 thyroid hormone your body would usually produce, which is needed for essential body functions."
748,Hypothyroidism,What is hypothyroidism?,"Hypothyroidism occurs when your body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormones. Thethyroidis a small, butterfly-shaped gland that sits in front of your windpipe. It releases hormones that help your body regulate and use energy. Thyroid hormones help control functions includinghow your heart beatsandhow your digestive system works. Without the right amount of thyroid hormones, your body’s natural functions begin to slow down. Also called underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism usually affects people over the age of 60 and is more common in women than men. It may be discovered through a routine blood test or after symptoms begin. Subclinical hypothyroidismis the name given to an early, mild form of the condition. If you’ve recently received a hypothyroidism diagnosis, it’s important to know that treatment is considered simple, safe, and effective. Most treatments rely on supplementing your low hormone levels with artificial hormones. These hormones will replace what your body isn’t producing on its own and help return your body’s functions to normal. Hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidismhave opposite effects. With hyperthyroidism, or overactive thyroid, the thyroid gland makes too much thyroid hormone. The greater amount of thyroid hormone causes some functions in your body to become faster, like your heart rate. You may also experience weight loss and difficulty sleeping. Hyperthyroidism is less common than hypothyroidism. It affects around1 percentof people ages 12 and older in the United States. Like hypothyroidism, it occurs more frequently in women and people over age 60. Medications, radioiodine therapy, and surgery may be used to treat hyperthyroidism."
749,Hypothyroidism,How common is hypothyroidism?,"Hypothyroidism is a fairly common condition. In the United States, almost5 percentof people ages 12 years old and up have hypothyroidism. The disease gets more common with age. People over 60 years old experience it more frequently. Women are more likely to have an underactive thyroid. In fact,1 in 8 womenwill develop thyroid issues."
750,Hypothyroidism,What are the signs and symptoms of hypothyroidism?,"Theeffects of hypothyroidismon the body often vary among different people and may be difficult to identify. The severity of the condition also affects which signs and symptoms appear and when. Early symptoms can includeweight gainandfatigue. Note that these both become more common as you age, regardless of your thyroid’s health. As a result, you may not realize that these changes are related to your thyroid until more symptoms appear. For instance, these may include skin changes associated with hypothyroidism, like scaly, rough, and dry skin and fragile nails. In general, the most common signs andsymptoms of hypothyroidisminclude: fatigue weight gain depression constipation feeling cold decreased sweating slowed heart rate elevated blood cholesterol dry skin dry,thinninghair impaired memory muscle weakness musclestiffness,aches, and tenderness painandstiffnessin your joints For most people, symptoms of the condition progress gradually over many years. As the thyroid slows more and more, the symptoms may become more easily identified. Of course, many of these symptoms also become more common with age in general. If you suspect your symptoms are the result of a thyroid problem, talk with your doctor. They can order a blood test to determine whether you have hypothyroidism. If you don’t already have a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through theHealthline FindCare tool. Besides the most common hypothyroidism symptoms,researchindicates that hypothyroidism symptoms in men may also include erectile dysfunction. Hypothyroidism symptoms in women may additionally include: fertility difficulties menstrual changes, particularly irregular or heavy periods problems during pregnancy, including anemia It’s also possible to develophypothyroidism during pregnancy. Symptoms will usually be similar to those of other cases of hypothyroidism. While hypothyroidism is less common in younger people, it can still occur. The condition may cause slower development inchildrenandearly pubertyin teenagers. Babies may also be born lacking thyroid function, a condition calledcongenital hypothyroidism. Symptoms of hypothyroidism in infants may include: sleeping more than usual constipation difficulty with feeding delayed growth (if the condition is untreated) In some cases, babies with hypothyroidism may show no symptoms. If hypothyroidism isn’t treated, you may develop additional symptoms: puffy, sensitive face hoarseness anemia loss of hearing In rare cases, severe hypothyroidism may result inmyxedema coma, a life threatening condition that requires emergency care. While the condition does not actually involve being in a coma, you may experience: fatigue hypothermia low blood pressure low heart rate"
751,Hypothyroidism,What causes hypothyroidism?,"The most common causes of hypothyroidism are: Hashimoto’s thyroiditis radioactive iodine treatment thyroid surgery radiation therapy medications iodine deficiency Less common causes include: pituitary disorders congenital disease pregnancy de Quervain thyroiditis Your immune system is designed to protect your body’s cells against invadingbacteria and viruses. When unknown bacteria or viruses enter your body, your immune system responds by sending fighter cells to destroy the foreign cells. Sometimes, your body confuses normal, healthy cells for invading cells. This is called an autoimmune response. If the autoimmune response isn’t regulated or treated, your immune system can attack healthy tissues. This can causeserious medical issues, including conditions such as hypothyroidism. Hashimoto’s thyroiditisis an autoimmune condition and themost common causeof an underactive thyroid in the United States. This disease attacks your thyroid gland, causing damage that reduces thyroid function. It most often affects middle-aged women, but it can occur in men and children. This condition also runs in families. If a family member has received a diagnosis of this disease, then your risk of having it is higher. If your thyroid gland produces too much thyroid hormone, you have a condition known ashyperthyroidism. Treatment for this condition aims to reduce and regulate thyroid hormone production. Standard treatment for hyperthyroidism usesradioactive iodineto destroy thyroid cells. This may cause the levels of your thyroid hormone to remain low permanently. Ifyour entire thyroid gland is removedas a result of thyroid problems, you’ll develop hypothyroidism. Using thyroid medication long term is the primary treatment. If only a portion of the gland is removed, your thyroid may still be able to produce enough hormones on its own. Blood tests will help determine how much thyroid medication you may need. If you’ve received a diagnosis of cancer of the head or neck,lymphoma, orleukemia, you may have undergoneradiation therapy. Radiation used for the treatment of these conditions may slow or halt the production of thyroid hormone, leading to hypothyroidism. Several medications may lower thyroid hormone production, resulting in hypothyroidism. These include ones used to treat mental health conditions, cancer, orheart disease, such as: lithium, which treats mania in bipolar disorder interleukin-2 (IL-2), an immunotherapy drug anti-CTLA-4 medications, which treat melanoma amiodarone(Pacerone), anantiarrhythmic drug stavudine, a medication forHIV Iodine deficiencyoccurs infrequently in the United States, but it is the most common cause of hypothyroidism in other parts of the world.Iodine, which is needed to produce thyroid hormone, is found infoodsincluding: iodized salt dairy seafood eggs If you have iodine deficiency, you may develop swelling at the base of your neck. This is called agoiter. It’s caused by an enlarged thyroid gland. Hypothyroidism may also result from problems involving thepituitary gland. This small gland in the brain produces hormones that affect many bodily functions, including the thyroid gland. Problems with the pituitary gland may cause thyroid issues. Pituitary disorders may result from: pituitary tumors medications like dopamine and opioids radiation therapy around the brain Sheehan syndrome, which damages the pituitary gland This type of hypothyroidism is called secondary hypothyroidism because the thyroid gland functions normally. It’s less common thanprimary hypothyroidism, which is caused by a problem with the thyroid gland. Congenital hypothyroidism is hypothyroidism that’s present in children from birth. It affects between1 in 2,000 and 1 in 4,000 newbornsand is twice as common in females. The condition occurs when the thyroid gland develops abnormally or is not present at all. Genetics or iodine deficiency may cause this. While some babies may show no symptoms, others will be less active or have trouble feeding. U.S. hospitals test newborns for the condition. It’s important to treat congenital hypothyroidism to prevent it from delaying growth or mental development. Around5to10 percentof pregnant people will develop postpartum thyroiditis several months after their pregnancy. While only some will need treatment, others will develop permanent hypothyroidism. The following can increase the risk of postpartum thyroiditis: history of postpartum thyroiditis presence of antibodies to thyroid peroxidase in the blood type 1 diabetes An upperrespiratory infectionthat damages thyroid cells may cause De Quervain thyroiditis, an uncommon condition that is also called subacute granulomatous thyroiditis. It’s most common in women and often occurs during thesummer and fall. Symptoms of de Quervain thyroiditis include: pain in the neck, jaw, and throat enlarged, tender thyroid gland fever fatigue body pain The condition may cause hyperthyroidism followed by hypothyroidism and last 2 to 8 weeks. Typically, thyroid function will then return to normal, though in some cases hypothyroidism may be permanent."
752,Hypothyroidism,What are the risk factors of hypothyroidism?,"Factors that can increase your risk of developing hypothyroidism include: being female being at least 60 years old being treated with radiation therapy to your neck or chest recently being pregnant having a family history of thyroid disorders having certain autoimmune conditions, such asSjögren’s diseaseandtype 1 diabetes"
753,Hypothyroidism,How is hypothyroidism diagnosed?,"Two primary tools are used to determine whether you have hypothyroidism: a medical evaluation and blood tests. Your doctor will complete a thoroughphysical examand medical history. They’ll check for physical signs of hypothyroidism, including: dry skin slowed reflexes swelling in the neck a slower heart rate In addition, your doctor will ask you to report any symptoms you’ve been experiencing, such as fatigue, constipation, or constantly feeling cold. If you have a known family history of thyroid conditions, tell your doctor during this exam. Blood tests are the only way to reliably confirm a diagnosis of hypothyroidism. Athyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) testmeasures how much TSH yourpituitary glandis creating: If your thyroid isn’t producing enough hormones, the pituitary gland will boost TSH to increase thyroid hormone production. The high TSH levels indicate hypothyroidism. If you have hyperthyroidism, your TSH levels will be low, as your body is trying to stop excessive thyroid hormone production. Athyroxine (T4) level testis also useful in diagnosing hypothyroidism. T4 is one of the hormones directly produced by your thyroid. Used together, T4 and TSH tests can help evaluate thyroid function. Typically, if you have a low level of T4 along with a high level of TSH, you have hypothyroidism. If you have subclinical hypothyroidism, though, you may have normal T4 with a high TSH level. Since there’s aspectrum of thyroid disease, other thyroid function tests may be necessary to properly diagnose your condition. If your T4 test is normal, you may also receive a triiodothyronine (T3) test. Low T3 levels may indicate hypothyroidism, though again, T3 levels may be normal in subclinical hypothyroidism. Finally, thyroid antibody tests look for antibodies in your blood to diagnose autoimmune thyroid disorders like Hashimoto’s thyroiditis."
754,Hypothyroidism,Which medications are available to treat hypothyroidism?,"Hypothyroidism is a lifelong condition. For many people, medication reduces or alleviates symptoms. Hypothyroidism is besttreatedby usinglevothyroxine(Levoxyl, Synthroid). This synthetic version of the T4 hormone copies the action of the thyroid hormone your body would normally produce. The medication is designed to return adequate levels of thyroid hormone to your blood. Once hormone levels are restored, symptoms of the condition are likely to disappear or at least become much more manageable. Once you start treatment, it will take several weeks before you’ll begin feeling relief. You’ll require follow-up blood tests to monitor your progress. You and your doctor will work together to find a dose and a treatment plan that best addresses your symptoms. This can take some time. In most cases, people with hypothyroidism must remain on this medication their entire lives. However, the amount you take may need to be adjusted, especially if you have Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. To make sure your medication is still working properly, your doctor will likely test your TSH levels yearly. If blood levels indicate the medication isn’t working as well as it should, your doctor will adjust the dose until a balance is achieved."
755,Hypothyroidism,What alternative treatments may help hypothyroidism?,"Besides standard thyroid medications,animal extracts that contain thyroid hormoneare also available. These extracts come from the thyroid glands of pigs. They contain both T4 andtriiodothyronine (T3). If you take levothyroxine, you’re only receiving T4. However, that’s all you need because your body is capable of producing T3 from the synthetic T4. Researchhas found medications with animal extracts to be similar to levothyroxine. Otherstudieshave indicated that taking animal thyroid extract may reduce thyroid symptoms but cause more side effects. Currently, animal thyroid extracts aren’t routinely recommended. You can also buy glandular extract supplements in some health food stores. Additionally,studiessuggest thatselenium supplementsmay help people with hypothyroidism caused by autoimmune disease, though research is mixed. Note that dietary supplements aren’t regulated as drugs by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Because of this, their potency, legitimacy, and purity aren’t guaranteed. Use these products at your own risk. It’s important to tell your doctor if you decide to try a supplement so they can adjust your treatment accordingly."
756,Hypothyroidism,What are the complications of hypothyroidism?,"Complications of hypothyroidisminclude: heart problems goiter nerve injury peripheral neuropathy carpal tunnel syndrome reduced kidney function myxedema coma, in cases of severe disease obstructive sleep apnea mental health issues, like anxiety and depression joint pain balance issues obesity, though thelinkis still being studied, and moderate weight gain is most likely high cholesterol infertility preeclampsia and anemia during pregnancy birth defects"
757,Hypothyroidism,Are there special dietary recommendations for people with hypothyroidism?,"As a general rule, you don’t need to follow a specificdiet for hypothyroidism. However, there are some recommendations to keep in mind. Your thyroid needs adequate amounts of iodine to fully function, but you don’t need to take an iodine supplement to achieve that. There are plenty ofiodine-rich foods, including: iodized salt dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese eggs seafood seaweed In general, a balanced diet should provide enough iodine for most people. Soymay be linked to hypothyroidism. Drinking or eating too many soy products may lower thyroid function, especially in people with thyroid disorders. However, more research in this area is needed. Soy is found in: tofu vegan cheese and meat products soy milk soybeans soy sauce It’s especially important for caregivers to monitor the soy intake of infants who need hypothyroidism treatment and also drink soy formula. Fibermay interfere with thyroid hormone absorption. Too much dietary fiber may prevent your body from getting the hormones it needs from thyroid medications. Fiber is vital, so don’t skip it entirely. Instead, avoid taking your medication within several hours of eatinghigh fiber foods. If you take supplements or medications in addition to thyroid medications, try to take them at different times. Other medications caninterfere withabsorption, so it’s best to take your thyroid medication without other supplements, medications, or foods."
758,Hypothyroidism,What are some tips for coping with hypothyroidism?,"Even if you’re undergoing treatment, you may deal with long lasting issues or complications from hypothyroidism. However, there are ways to lessen the condition’s effect on your quality of life. There’s a link between other autoimmune diseases and hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism often goes along with conditions such as: celiac disease diabetes rheumatoid arthritis (RA) lupus disorders affecting theadrenal gland pituitary problems Despite taking medication, you may still experience fatigue from time to time. To help you manage low energy levels, it’s important that you: get quality sleep each night eat a diet rich in fruits and vegetables consider the use of stress-relieving mechanisms, such asmeditationandyoga A2018 studyfound that yoga improved fatigue and other symptoms in a small group of people with hypothyroidism, though more research is needed. Having achronic health conditioncan be difficult, especially if it’s accompanied by other health concerns. Since hypothyroidism can cause depression and fatigue, it may also make yourrelationships more challenging. Find people with whom you can openly express your feelings and experiences. This might be a: mental health counselor close friend family member support group of other people living with the condition Some hospitals sponsor meetings for people with health conditions including hypothyroidism. Ask for a recommendation from your doctor and consider attending a meeting. Researchindicates that online communities may also help strengthen social connections, provide a supportive space, and help people with chronic illnesses share advice. Support groups can help you connect withpeople who understandexactly what you’re experiencing while offering a guiding hand."
759,Hypothyroidism,What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and depression?,"When levels of thyroid hormones are low, your body’s natural functions lag. This can cause a variety of symptoms, including fatigue, weight gain, and evendepression. A small 2016 study found that60 percentof participants with hypothyroidism exhibited some symptoms of depression. Hypothyroidism may cause a range of mental health difficulties. This can make diagnosing hypothyroidism difficult. Before making a treatment plan for mental health issues, doctors may consider testing for an underactive thyroid. Depression and hypothyroidismcan share several symptoms. These include: fatigue weight gain depressed mood reduced desire and satisfaction difficulty concentrating The two conditions also have symptoms that may distinguish them from one another. For hypothyroidism, problems such as dry skin, constipation, and hair loss are common. For depression alone, these conditions wouldn’t be expected. Depression is often a diagnosis made based on symptoms and medical history. Low thyroid function is diagnosed with a physical exam and blood tests. To see whether there’s a link between your depression and your thyroid function, your doctor can order these tests for a definitive diagnosis. If your depression is caused only by hypothyroidism, correcting the thyroid disorder should treat the depression. If it doesn’t, your doctor may prescribe medications for both conditions. They’ll slowly adjust your doses until your depression and hypothyroidism are better managed."
760,Hypothyroidism,What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and anxiety?,"While hypothyroidism has long been associated with depression, a2016 studysuggested it may be associated withanxietytoo. Researchers evaluated 100 people between the ages of 18 and 45 who had a known history of hypothyroidism. Using an anxiety questionnaire, they found that around 63 percent of them met the criteria for some form of anxiety. Larger and more focused studies on anxiety may help determine whether a true connection exists between hypothyroidism and anxiety. It’s important for you and your doctor to discuss all your symptoms when being evaluated for thyroid or mental health conditions."
761,Hypothyroidism,What’s the effect of hypothyroidism on pregnancy?,"People with thyroid problems can and very often do have healthy pregnancies. Still, hypothyroidism can pose a particular set of challenges for pregnancy. Low thyroid function or unmanagedhypothyroidism during pregnancycan cause: anemia miscarriage preeclampsia stillbirth low birth weight brain development problems birth defects If you have hypothyroidism and are pregnant, it’s important to take the following steps during the time you’re expecting: You can develop hypothyroidism while pregnant. Some doctors routinely check thyroid levels during pregnancy to monitor for low thyroid hormone levels. If your levels are lower than they should be, your doctor may suggest treatment. Some people who never had thyroid problems before they were pregnant may develop them after having a baby. This is calledpostpartum thyroiditis. In many cases, the condition resolves within12 to 18 months, and medication is no longer required. However, around 20 percent of people with postpartum thyroiditis will need long-term therapy. Continue to take your medication as prescribed. It’s common to have regular testing so your doctor can make any necessary adjustments to your thyroid medication as your pregnancy progresses. This ensures that the baby is getting enough thyroid hormone for their brain and nervous system to develop normally. Your body needs more nutrients, vitamins, and minerals while you’re pregnant. Eating abalanced dietandtaking multivitamins while pregnantcan help you maintain a healthy pregnancy. It’s also important to get enough iodine, which is essential for producing thyroid hormone. Aim to consume around250 microgramsof iodine each day through food or supplements. Remember to talk with your doctor before starting any new supplements."
762,Hypothyroidism,What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and weight gain?,"Your thyroid is responsible for many of your body’s daily functions, including metabolism, organ function, andtemperature control. When your body doesn’t produce enough thyroid hormone, all of these functions can slow down. If your thyroid gland doesn’t function properly, yourbasal metabolic rate— a measurement of the amount of energy your body uses at rest — may be low. As a result, an underactive thyroid may lead to some weight gain. The more severe the condition is, the greater your weight gain is likely to be. The typical amount of weight gain isn’t very high, though. Most people will gain somewhere between5 and 10 pounds. Properly treating the condition may lead you to lose any weight you gained while your thyroid levels were not treated. However, keep in mind that that’s not always the case. Symptoms of an underactive thyroid, including weight gain, often develop over a long period of time and may not be caused by a thyroid disorder alone. If your weight stays the same, it doesn’t mean the condition isn’t being properly treated. Instead, it may indicate that your weight gain was the result of lifestyle or other conditions rather than low hormone levels."
763,Hypothyroidism,What’s the connection between hypothyroidism and weight loss?,"Once you’re treated for hypothyroidism, you may lose any weight you gained from low hormone levels. That’s because once your thyroid levels are restored, your ability tomanage your weightreturns to normal. If you’re treating hypothyroidism but don’t see a change in your weight, you may still be able to lose weight if that’s a goal for you. Work with a doctor,registered dietitian, or personal trainer to develop a healthy eating plan andexercise strategyto reach or maintain a moderate weight."
764,Hypothyroidism,Frequently asked questions,"Hypothyroidism and anemia may havesimilar symptoms, such as fatigue. A doctor will run several tests to determine the underlying cause of your symptoms. If left untreated, hypothyroidism may lead to anemia due to malabsorption of iron. According to a2017 review, Hashimoto’s thyroiditis may impact how your body absorbs certain nutrients. This may include iron. Over time, this may lead to anemia. The authors of a2017 reviewsuggest that hypothyroidism may be linked withseveral types of anemia, such as normochromic normocytic, hypochromic microcytic, and megaloblastic types."
765,Hypothyroidism,The takeaway,"Your body naturally goes through changesas you get older. If you notice a significant difference in how you feel or how your body is responding, talk with your doctor to see whether a thyroid problem may be affecting you. If you’re a woman over age 60, remember that you’re at higher risk of a thyroid disorder. If you have hypothyroidism, you’ll probably need to take thyroid medications for the rest of your life. Still, it’s likely that medication will help relieve or resolve your symptoms. You may also benefit from joining a support group for people living with hypothyroidism."
766,Indigestion,Overview,"In April 2020, theFood and Drug Administration (FDA)requested that all forms of prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) ranitidine (Zantac) be removed from the U.S. market. This recommendation was made because unacceptable levels of NDMA, a probable carcinogen (cancer-causing chemical), were found in some ranitidine products. If you’re prescribed ranitidine, talk with your doctor about safe alternative options before stopping the drug. If you’re taking OTC ranitidine, stop taking the drug and talk with your healthcare provider about alternative options. Instead of taking unused ranitidine products to a drug take-back site, dispose of them according to the product’s instructions or by following the FDA’sguidance. Ranitidine, brand name Zantac, is now marketed as Zantac 360, which contains a different active ingredient (famotidine). Famotidine is in the same class as ranitidine and works the same way but has not been found to contain unacceptable levels of NDMA. You may have indigestion after eating some foods, such as greasy or spicy foods, taking certain medications, or due to an underlying health condition. Treatment can depend on the cause. Indigestion is the name given to a collection of digestive symptoms, including a feeling of fullness or discomfort in your upper abdomen, heartburn, and nausea. The medical term for indigestion is dyspepsia. People often experience indigestion after eating large meals. However, several other factors can lead you to develop symptoms of indigestion."
767,Indigestion,Causes of indigestion,"There are many possiblecausesof indigestion. These can range from dietary and lifestyle habits to the side effects of medications and serious underlying conditions. You experience indigestion when your body cannot digest food as normal. This may be the result of eating a lot or eating too fast. Spicy, greasy, and fatty foods alsoincrease the riskof indigestion. Lying down too soon after eating can make it harder to digest food. This increases your risk of abdominal discomfort. Other common causes of poor digestion include: smoking drinking too muchalcohol stress Indigestion can be aside effectof taking specific medications. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, such as aspirin, ibuprofen, andnaproxen, are one class of medications that can cause indigestion. Antibiotics, medications that treat or prevent bacterial infections, can also irritate the digestive system andcauseindigestion as a side effect. Several medical conditions can alsocauseindigestion. These include: gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) gastric cancer pancreatic or bile duct abnormalities peptic ulcers lactose,gluten, and other intolerances irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) gastroparesis Sometimes you may experience indigestion with no apparent cause. The medical term for this is functional dyspepsia. Learn more about functional dyspepsia here."
768,Indigestion,Symptoms of indigestion,"Indigestion can cause: abdominal painorbloating heartburn nausea vomiting Other common symptoms include: quickly feeling full during a meal burning sensation in the stomach or esophagus experiencing excessive gas or belching Indigestion may accompany severe symptoms such as: vomit that isbloodyor looks likecoffee grounds unexplained weight loss black stools trouble swallowing If you experience any of these severe symptoms, seek medical assistance immediately."
769,Indigestion,Complications of indigestion,"Indigestion does not typically lead to severe complications. However, severe or persistent symptoms may make it more difficult for you to eat the necessary amount of food. This may have an effect on the overallnutritional balanceof your diet. You may also experience indigestion alongside other symptoms, which themselves can lead to complications. For example, GERD canlead tothe following complications: esophageal stricture pyloric stenosis Barrett’s esophagus"
770,Indigestion,Diagnosing indigestion,"Your doctor will likely start by asking questions about your medical history and eating habits. You may also undergo a physical examination. Your doctor might orderX-raysof your abdomen to see if there are any abnormalities in your digestive tract. They may also collect blood, breath, and stool samples to check for a type of bacteria that causes peptic ulcers. Your doctor can also order an endoscopic exam to check your upper digestive tract for abnormalities. During anendoscopy, your doctor passes a small tube with a camera and biopsy tool through your esophagus into your stomach. They can then check the lining of the digestive tract for diseases and collect tissue samples. An upper gastrointestinal (GI) endoscopy can diagnose the following: refluxesophagitis ulcers inflammatory diseases"
771,Indigestion,Treatment options for indigestion,"Indigestion often goes away on its own and will pass with time. For example, if you experience indigestion after a large meal, your abdominal discomfort may lessen as your body begins to digest the food you’ve eaten. However, some medications and lifestyle changes can help you treat and prevent indigestion symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe medications to treat common indigestion symptoms, but they can cause side effects. H2 receptor antagonists (H2RAs)like Pepcid reduce stomach acid. Side effects are uncommon but can include: nausea vomiting diarrhea rashor itching constipation headache bleeding orbruising Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), like Prilosec, reduce stomach acid but are stronger than H2RAs. Side effects include: nausea and vomiting constipation diarrhea cough headache backache dizziness abdominal pain Prokinetics, like prescription medications Reglan and Motilium, improve the muscle action of the digestive tract. However, taking these medications may cause side effects, including: depression anxiety involuntary movements or spasms fatigue Medication isn‘t the only treatment for indigestion. You may be able to improve digestion and relieve uncomfortable symptoms with lifestyle changes. For example, it can be helpful to: avoid foods that can trigger heartburn eat slower don’t eat before lying down try to stopsmoking, if you smoke try to maintain a moderate weight reduce the amount of coffee, soft drinks, and alcohol you consume reduce stress throughyogaor relaxationtherapy"
772,Indigestion,Outlook,"Poor digestion is a common problem. However, you shouldn’t ignore indigestion that‘s: chronic (long term) severe unresponsive to OTC medication If left untreated, the symptoms of indigestion may interfere with your quality of life. If you’re unable to manage indigestion at home, speak with a doctor. They can help determine the underlying cause of your digestion issues. If you experience severe nausea and vomiting, black stools, and unrelenting upper abdominal pain associated with your indigestion, seek emergency medical care."

775,Insomnia,Types of insomnia,"Experts describe insomnia in different ways, depending on its characteristics.Types of insomniacan include: Acute insomnia:This type refers to short-term sleeping difficulties that generally last no more than a few weeks. Chronic insomnia:Long-lasting insomnia that affects your sleep for at least3 daysevery week for a period of 3 months or longer is referred to aschronic insomnia. It can be primary (idiopathic) with no known cause, or secondary (comorbid), relating to another health condition. Onset insomnia:If you have difficulty falling asleep, you may have onset insomnia. Trouble getting to sleep might result from caffeine use, mental health symptoms, or other common insomnia triggers, but it can also develop with other sleep disorders. Maintenance insomnia occurs when you have trouble remaining asleep once you get to sleep or consistently wake up too early. This type of insomnia might relate to underlying health and mental health symptoms,but lying awake and worrying you won’t get enough sleep can make it worse. Behavioral insomnia of childhood:Doctors diagnose this type of insomnia in children who have consistenttrouble falling asleep, refusal to go to bed, or both. Children with this condition often benefit from learning self-soothing strategies and following a regular sleep routine."
776,Insomnia,Insomnia causes and risk factors,"Causes of insomnia can vary depending on which type you have. Possiblecausesof acute insomnia are recent stressors, such as an upsetting ortraumatic eventorjet lag. Chronic insomniacan occuras a result of: chronic pain conditions, such asarthritisorback pain psychological conditions, such asanxiety,depression, orsubstance use disorders sleep apneaand other sleep disorders health conditions such asdiabetesorgastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) Insomniais related to age, sex, and genetics. It’s more common in certain life phases, including: inolder adulthood just before, during, and aftermenopause in people who are pregnant Otherrisk factors associated with insomniainclude: a sedentary lifestyle shift work taking naps drinking caffeine Insomnia is common during pregnancy, especially in thefirstandthirdtrimesters. Pregnancy-related insomniausually passes and doesn’t affect your baby’s development. But getting the right amount of sleep is important for your overall well-being. Lifestyle changes that could help include: eating abalanced diet maintaining a consistent sleep schedule practicing relaxation techniques during the day to help ease anxiety and promote calm"
777,Insomnia,Insomnia in children,"Children andteenscan develop insomnia often for the same reasons as adults. Symptoms can include: daytime sleepiness or restlessness irritability and mood changes repeated disciplinary issues problems with memory and focus The first step to treating insomnia in children generally involvessetting a firm bedtimeand sticking to it. Other helpful tips include: creating a soothing bedtime routine following good sleep hygiene practices, like avoiding screen time near bedtime reducing sources of stress in your child’s life A therapist or pediatrician can offer more guidance on treating insomnia in children."
778,Insomnia,Insomnia in older adulthood,"According to 2019 research,up to 75%of older adults experience some symptoms of insomnia. Different factors contribute toinsomnia in older adulthood, and these can have a domino effect: age-related changes in thecircadian rhythms retirement, as you may no longer have a consistent daytime schedule or get regular social interaction social isolation can contribute to loneliness and increase your chances of experiencingdepression health concerns related to aging, including chronic pain conditions daytime napping, if you’re not getting enough sleep at night, can leave you less tired at bedtime, fueling a cycle of sleeplessness If you experience insomnia, a therapist or clinician can offer more support in finding helpful treatment options."
779,Insomnia,Receiving an insomnia diagnosis,"To diagnose insomnia, a healthcare professional will ask questions about: any existing medical conditions physical and mental health symptoms you’ve noticed stressors in your personal or professional life sleep history, including how long you’ve had symptoms and how they affect you This can help determine the underlying causes of your sleep problems. They may also ask you to keep an app-based or written sleep log for 2 to 4 weeks, tracking: what time you go to bed the approximate time it takes you to fallasleep any instances of repeated waking in the night what time you wake up each day They may order medical tests or blood work to help rule out medical conditions that can interfere with sleep. If they suspect you could have an underlying sleep disorder, such asobstructive sleep apnea, they may recommend asleep study. You’ll likely receive a clinical diagnosis of insomnia if your sleep difficulties occur at least 3 nights a week for a minimum of 3 months and if they create major distress or difficulties in your daily life."
780,Insomnia,Treating insomnia,"You have severaloptions for treating insomnia, including therapy, medications, supplements, and natural remedies. TheAmerican College of Physicians (ACP)recommendsCBT-Ias a first-line treatment forchronic insomniain adults. With support from a therapist, you can learn specific techniques to address insomnia, including: Stimulus control:teaches you to get out of bed and find a quiet and relaxing activity until you feel sleepy, limiting the time you maylie awake and worry about falling asleep Sleep restriction:restricts and then gradually increases the amount of time you spend in bed Bright light therapy:exposes you tobright lightin the morning or evening, depending on whether you have more trouble falling asleep or staying asleep A therapist may also offer guidance on relaxation techniquesandsleep hygiene practicesthat address behaviors that preventyou from getting quality sleep. A therapist can also identify underlying mental health symptoms contributing to insomnia or making your symptoms worse. Addressing these triggers and contributing factors can go a long way toward relieving insomnia. Your clinician mightprescribe medication(or Z-drugs) if therapy and lifestyle changes don’t work. Example medications include: eszopiclone(Lunesta) zolpidem(Ambien) triazolam (Halcion) They may recommend a medication in combination with therapy with the goal of ultimately sleeping without medication. Over-the-counter (OTC) supplements likemelatonincan offer some relief from insomnia. Melatonin supplements may slightlydecrease the timeit takes you to fall asleep. Support for melatonin as an insomnia treatment remains inconclusive. Experts have yet to confirm whether it’ssafe to use melatonin long term, though it’s generally considered safe for short-term use. Check in with a healthcare professional before trying supplements like melatonin or OTC medications to help ease insomnia. These medications mayinteractwith other prescription and OTC medications or cause side effects.If you’re pregnant, always ask your healthcare team before taking any medications or supplements. Lifestyle changes andhome remediescan often help manage insomnia symptoms. You can try: Natural sleep aids:Before bed, trywarm milk,herbal tea, orvalerian.

784,Iron Deficiency Anemia,Overview,"Low iron levels can mean you have iron-deficiency anemia. It can occur for many reasons, including not consuming enough iron or experiencing blood loss. Anemia occurs when you have a decreased level of hemoglobin in your red blood cells (RBCs). Hemoglobin is the protein in your RBCs that’s responsible for carrying oxygen to your tissues. Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. It occurs when your body doesn’t have enough iron, which your body needs to make hemoglobin. When there isn’t enough iron in your blood, the rest of your body can’t get the amount of oxygen it needs. While the condition may be common, many people don’t know they have iron-deficiency anemia. It’s possible to experience symptoms for years without knowing the cause. In individuals of childbearing age, acommon causeof iron-deficiency anemia is a loss of iron in the blood due to heavy menstruation or pregnancy. A poor diet, or certain intestinal diseases that affect how the body absorbs iron, can also cause iron-deficiency anemia. Read on to take a closer look at the symptoms, causes, and treatment of iron deficiency anemia."
785,Iron Deficiency Anemia,What are the symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia?,"The symptoms of iron-deficiencyanemiacan be mild at first, and you may not even notice them. According to theAmerican Society of Hematology (ASH), most people don’t realize they have mild anemia until they have a routine blood test. The symptoms of moderate to severeiron-deficiencyanemia can include: general fatigue weakness pale skin shortness of breath dizziness strange cravings to eat items with no nutritional value (pica) a tingling or crawling feeling in the legs tongue swellingor soreness cold hands and feet fast orirregular heartbeat brittle nails headaches"
786,Iron Deficiency Anemia,What are the causes of iron-deficiency anemia?,"According to the ASH, iron deficiency is the most common cause of anemia. There are many reasons that a person might become deficient in iron. These include: Eating too little iron over an extended period of time can cause a shortage in your body. Foods such as meat, eggs, and some green leafy vegetables are high in iron. Because iron is essential during times of rapid growth and development, pregnant people and young children may need even moreiron-rich foodsin their diet. Heavy menstrual bleeding is a common cause of iron-deficiency anemia in individuals of childbearing age. So is pregnancy, because your body needs more iron during this time in order to create enough oxygen for the baby. Certain medical conditions can cause internal bleeding, which can lead to iron-deficiency anemia. Examples include astomach ulcer, polyps in thecolonor intestines, orcolon cancer. Regular use of certain pain relievers, such as aspirin, can also lead to bleeding in the stomach. Certain disorders or surgeries that affect the intestines can also interfere with how your body absorbs iron. Even if you get enough iron in your diet,celiac diseaseor intestinal surgery such as gastric bypass may limit the amount of iron your body can absorb. If you haveendometriosis, you may have heavy blood loss during menstrual periods. You may not even know you have endometriosis because it occurs hidden in the abdominal or pelvic area outside of the uterus. Some conditions — like celiac disease — that can make it difficult to absorb enough iron are passed down through families. There are also genetic conditions or mutations that can add to the problem. One of these is theTMPRSS6 mutation. This mutation causes your body to make too much hepcidin. Hepcidin is a hormone that can block your intestines from absorbing iron. Other genetic conditions may contribute to anemia by causing abnormal bleeding. Examples includeVon Willebrand diseaseandhemophilia."
787,Iron Deficiency Anemia,What are the risk factors of iron-deficiency anemia?,"Anemia is a common condition and can occur in people of any age and from any ethnic group. Some people may be at greater risk of iron-deficiency anemia than others, including: individuals of childbearing age pregnant people people with poor diets people who donate blood frequently infants and children, especially thoseborn prematurelyor experiencing a growth spurt vegetarians who don’t replace meat with another iron-rich food teenagers who have a greater need for iron in periods of rapid growth adults over age 65 people exposed to lead in their environment or water high-performance and endurance athletes like marathon runners If you’re at risk of iron-deficiency anemia, talk with a doctor to determine if blood testing or dietary changes could benefit you."
788,Iron Deficiency Anemia,Why is iron-deficiency anemia more common in women?,"The use ofbinaryterms such as “male” and “female” or “men” and “women” in this article reflects the language of the sources we’ve used. Unless otherwise noted, it’s unclear whether the research we reference included participants withexpansive gender identities. Pregnancy, significant menstrual bleeding, endometriosis, and uterinefibroidsare all reasons that women are more likely to experience iron-deficiency anemia. Heavy menstrual bleedingoccurs when a woman bleeds more or longer than usual during menstruation. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), typical menstrual bleeding lasts for 4 to 5 days, and the amount of blood lost ranges from 2 to 3 tablespoons. Individuals with excess menstrual bleeding typically bleed for more than 7 days and lose twice as much blood as those with typical menstrual bleeding. A pelvic ultrasound can help a doctor look for the source of excess bleeding during a woman’s period, such as fibroids. Like iron-deficiency anemia, uterine fibroids often don’t cause symptoms. They occur when muscular tumors grow in the uterus. While they’re not usually cancerous, fibroids can cause heavy menstrual bleeding that can lead to iron-deficiency anemia."
789,Iron Deficiency Anemia,How is iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed?,"A doctor can diagnose anemia with blood tests. These include: Acomplete blood count (CBC)is usually the first test a doctor will use. A CBC measures the amount of cellular or cell-related components in the blood, including: red blood cells (RBCs) white blood cells (WBCs) hemoglobin hematocrit platelets A CBC provides information about your blood that’s helpful in diagnosing iron-deficiency anemia. This information includes: the hematocrit level, which is the percent of blood volume made up of RBCs thehemoglobinlevel the size of your RBCs In iron-deficiency anemia, the hematocrit and hemoglobin levels are low. Also, RBCs are usually smaller in size than normal. A CBC test is often performed as part of a routinephysical examination. It’s a good indicator of a person’s overall health. It may also be performed routinely before surgery. This test is useful for diagnosing this type of anemia because most people who have an iron deficiency don’t realize it. Anemia can usually be confirmed with a CBC test. Your doctor might order additional blood tests to determine how severe your anemia is and help determine treatments. They may also examine your blood through a microscope. These blood tests will provide information, including: the iron level in your blood your RBC size and color (RBCs are pale if they’re deficient in iron) yourferritin level yourtotal iron-binding capacity (TIBC) Ferritin is a protein that helps with iron storage in your body. Low levels of ferritin indicate low iron storage. A TIBC test is used to reflect the amount of transferrin that’s carrying iron. Transferrin is a protein that transports iron. Certain at-home test kits can check iron levels, ferritin levels, and TIBC. If your doctor is concerned thatinternal bleedingis causing your anemia, additional tests may be needed. One test you may have is a fecal occult test to look forblood in your feces. Blood in your feces may indicate bleeding in your intestine. Your doctor may also perform anendoscopy, in which they use a small camera on a flexible tube to view the linings of your gastrointestinal tract. Here are the two types: AnEGD test, also called an upper GI endoscopy, allows a doctor to examine the lining of the esophagus, stomach, and upper part of the small intestine. Acolonoscopy, also called a lower GI endoscopy, allows a doctor to examine the lining of the colon, which is the lower portion of the large intestine. These tests can help identify sources ofgastrointestinal bleeding."
790,Iron Deficiency Anemia,What are the health complications of iron-deficiency anemia?,"Most cases of iron-deficiency anemia are mild and don’t cause complications. The condition can usually be corrected easily. However, if anemia or iron deficiency is left untreated, it can lead to other health problems. These include: When you’re anemic, your heart has to pump more blood to make up for the low amount of oxygen. This can lead to an irregular heartbeat. In severe cases, it can lead toheart failureor anenlarged heart. In severe cases of iron deficiency, a child may be born prematurely or with a low birth weight. Most pregnant people take iron supplements as part of their prenatal care to prevent this from happening. Infants and children who are severely deficient in iron may experience delayed growth and development and be more prone to infections."
791,Iron Deficiency Anemia,How is iron-deficiency anemia treated?,"How your iron-deficiency anemia is treated will depend on how severe the problem is and what caused it in the first place. Most forms of this condition involve a lack of iron in your diet or problems with your body absorbing the iron you do consume. Below are some options for treatment. Iron tablets can help restore iron levels in your body. If possible, you should take iron tablets on an empty stomach, which helps the body absorb them better. If they upset your stomach, you can take them with meals. You may need to take the supplements for several months. Iron supplements may cause constipation or black stools. Diets that include the following foods can help treat or prevent iron deficiency: red meat dark green, leafy vegetables dried fruits nuts iron-fortified cereals Additionally, vitamin C may help your body absorb iron. If you’re taking iron tablets, a doctor might suggest taking the tablets along with a source of vitamin C, such as a glass of orange juice or citrus fruit. You may also need to consider foods or drinks, such as black tea, that can lower your iron levels or decrease iron absorption. Iron supplements won’t help as much if excess bleeding causes the deficiency. A doctor may prescribe birth control pills to individuals who have heavy periods. This can reduce the amount of menstrual bleeding each month. If your bleeding is caused by an injury, tear, or other internal problem, surgery could be required to stop the bleeding. In the most severe cases, ared blood cell transfusionor intravenous iron can quickly replace iron and blood loss."
792,Iron Deficiency Anemia,How to prevent iron-deficiency anemia,"Iron-deficiency anemia, caused by inadequate iron intake, can be prevented by eating a diet high iniron-rich foodsandvitamin C. Mothers should feed their babies breast milk or iron-fortified infant formula."
793,Iron Deficiency Anemia,Takeaway,"Iron-deficiency anemia is the most common type of anemia. It occurs when your body doesn’t have enough iron. Potential causes include not eating enough iron-rich foods, blood loss due to menstruation, and inability to absorb iron. If you suspect you have an iron deficiency, see a doctor. They can diagnose anemia with blood tests. Don’t try to diagnose and treat iron-deficiency anemia by yourself. You could end up with too much iron in your blood which can cause other health conditions, includingconstipationand evenliver damage."
794,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),Overview,"IBS is a common condition affecting 7% to 16% of people in America, characterized by symptoms like cramping, abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel habits. The exact cause of IBS remains unknown, but potential triggers include stress, certain foods, and an overly sensitive colon. There is currently no cure for IBS, but treatment focuses on symptom relief and prevention through home remedies, dietary changes, and medication. According to research from 2021,7–16 %of Americans experience irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms. The condition affects more women and young people. Some people with IBS have minor symptoms. However, for others, the symptoms are significant and disrupt daily life. Learn about IBS, its symptoms, causes, triggers, and treatment."
795,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),What is IBS?,"IBS is also known as spastic colon, irritable colon, mucous colitis, and spastic colitis. It is a separate condition frominflammatory bowel diseaseand isn’t related to other bowel conditions. IBS is a group of intestinal symptoms that typically occur together. The symptoms vary in severity and duration from person to person. Types of IBS are classified based on certain specific symptoms that occur, such as constipation and weight loss. Oneoverview from 2018indicates that to diagnose IBS, healthcare professionals look for symptoms that have occurred at least 3 days per month for the last 3 months. IBS can cause intestinal damage in some cases. However, this is not common. According to a2022 study, IBS doesn’t increase your risk of gastrointestinal cancers. But it can still have a significant effect on your life."
796,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),What does IBS feel like?,"The symptoms of IBS typically include: cramping abdominal pain bloating and gas constipation diarrhea It’s not uncommon for people with IBS to have episodes of both constipation and diarrhea. Symptoms such as bloating and gas typically go away after you have a bowel movement. Symptoms of IBS aren’t always persistent. They can resolve, only to come back. However, some people do have continuous symptoms. IBS pain may feel like cramping. With this cramping, you will also have at least two of the following experiences: some relief of pain after a bowel movement a change in how often you have a bowel movement changes in the way your stools look"
797,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),What causes IBS?,"Although there are many ways to treat IBS, the exact cause of IBS isunknown. Possible causes include an overly sensitive colon or immune system.Postinfectious IBSis caused by a previous bacterial infection in the gastrointestinal tract. The varied possible causes make IBS difficult to prevent. The physical processes involved in IBS can also vary but may consist of the following: slowed or spastic movements of the colon, causing painful cramping abnormal serotonin levels in the colon, affecting motility and bowel movements a bacterial imbalance in the digestive tract Per one2017 study, IBS risk factorsmay include: contractingfood poisoning being assigned female at birth being exposed to antibiotics having anxiety or depression somatic symptom disorderor neuroticism"
798,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),How do doctors diagnose IBS?,"Your doctor may be able todiagnose IBSbased on your symptoms. They may also take one or more of the following steps to rule out other possible causes of your symptoms: prescribe adopting a certain eating pattern or avoid specific food groups for a time to rule out any food allergies order tests to examine your stool sample to rule out infection order blood tests to check for anemia and rule outceliac disease order acolonoscopy Your doctor will typically only order a colonoscopy if they suspect thatcolitis, inflammatory bowel disease (Crohn’s diseaseandulcerative colitis), or cancer is causing your symptoms. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, you can check out ourFindCare tool."
799,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),What triggers IBS?,"For many people, the key to managing IBS symptoms is to track andavoid triggers. This2021 studynotes that stress and anxiety can be triggers for IBS symptoms for many people. Your nervous system, to a great degree, controls the automatic movement, or motility, of your digestive system. This means thatstresscan affect your nerves, making your digestive system overactive. If you have IBS, your colon may be overly responsive to even slight disruptions of your digestive system. It is also believed that IBS is affected by the immune system, which is also affected by stress. More often, certain foods can be common triggers for many people with IBS. However, some of these foods may have a greater effect on you than on others. It may help to keep a food diary for a while to learn which foods are triggers for you. Some foods that youmay needto limit or exclude include: beans foods that contain sorbitol, mannitol, or xylitol onions and some other vegetables, fruits certain dairy foods certain carbohydrate foods"
800,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),What is the best treatment for IBS?,"There is currently no cure for IBS.Treatmentis aimed at symptom relief and prevention. Initially, your doctor may have you make certain lifestyle changes. Thesehome remediesare typically suggested before the use of medication. Certain home remedies or lifestyle changesmay helprelieve your IBS symptoms without the use of medication. Examples of these lifestyle changes include: participating in regular physical activity, such as exercising limiting consuming caffeinated beverages since caffeine stimulates the intestines minimizing stress (talk therapy,mindfulness,hypnotherapy, andmeditationpractices may help) takingprobiotics(“good” bacteria normally found in the intestines) to help relieve gas and bloating takingfiber supplements quitting smoking if you smoke since IBSmay be more prevalentamong people who smoke For some people,dietary changescan go a long way in helping ease symptoms. This includes eating smaller meals and avoiding foods that trigger symptoms. A common eating pattern that doctors and registered dietitians recommend for IBS is thelow FODMAPdiet. AFODMAPis a kind of carbohydrate found inside certain foods. Studies have shown links between FODMAPs and some common digestive issues. Because IBS symptoms vary among people with the condition, approaches to dietary changes need to vary. If your symptoms do not improve through home remedies, such as lifestyle or dietary changes, your doctor may suggestmedicationtherapy. Different people can respond differently to the same medication, so you may need to work with your doctor to find the right medication for you. As with all medications, when considering a new treatment option, it’s important to tell your doctor what you are already taking, including herbal remedies and over-the-counter (OTC) medications. This will help your doctor avoid any medication that could interact with what you are already taking. Some drugsare usedto treat all symptoms of IBS, while other drugs are focused on specific symptoms. Drugs that are used include: medications to manage muscle spasms anti-constipation drugs tricyclic antidepressantsto help ease pain antibiotics If your main IBS symptom is constipation, there are two drugs theAmerican College of Gastroenterology (ACG)recommends: linaclotide (Linzess) lubiprostone (Amitiza)"
801,Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS),When should you see a doctor for IBS?,"Consider talking with your doctor if you have symptoms lasting longer than a few days or if symptoms become a common occurrence. You should also speak with your doctor if you experience sudden changes or serious symptoms, such as: rectal bleeding persistent pain that is not relieved from passing gas or having a bowel movement weight loss decreased appetite nausea and vomiting These symptomscould indicatea more serious condition, such ascolon cancer."

804,Joint Pain,Overview,
805,Joint Pain,Overview,"Joints are the parts of your body where your bones meet. Joints allow the bones of yourskeletonto move. Joints include: shoulders hips elbows knees Joint pain refers to discomfort, aches, and soreness in any of the body’s joints. Joint pain is a common complaint. It doesn’t typically require a hospital visit. Sometimes, joint pain is the result of an illness or injury. Arthritis is also a common cause of joint pain. However, it can also be due to other conditions or factors."
806,Joint Pain,What causes joint pain?,"One of the most common causes of joint pain is arthritis. The two main forms of arthritis areosteoarthritis(OA) andrheumatoid arthritis(RA). According to theAmerican College of Rheumatology, OA is most common in adults over age 40. It progresses slowly and tends to affect commonly used joints like the: wrists hands hips knees Joint pain due to OA results from a breakdown of the cartilage that serves as a cushion and shock absorber for the joints. The second form of arthritis is RA. According to theArthritis Foundation, RA affects about 1.5 million Americans. It more commonly affects women than men. It can deform and debilitate the joints over time. RA causes pain, inflammation, and fluid buildup in the joints as the body’s immune system attacks the membrane that lines the joints. Joint pain can be caused by: bursitis, or inflammation of the cushioning pads around joints lupus gout certain infectious diseases, such asmumps,influenza, andhepatitis chondromalaciaof the patella, or a breakdown of the cartilage in the kneecap an injury tendinitis, or inflammation of the tendon an infection of the bone or joint overuse of a joint cancer fibromyalgia osteoporosis sarcoidosis rickets"
807,Joint Pain,What are the symptoms of joint pain?,"In some cases, your joint pain will require you to see a doctor. You should make an appointment if you don’t know the cause of your joint pain and are experiencing other unexplained symptoms. You should also see a doctor if: the area around the joint is swollen, red, tender, or warm to the touch the pain persists for three days or more you have a fever but no other signs of the flu Go to the emergency room if any of the following occurs: You’ve experienced a serious injury. The joint appears deformed. Swelling of the joint occurs suddenly. The joint is completely immobile. You have severe joint pain. You can book an appointment with a primary care doctor in your area using ourHealthline FindCare tool."
808,Joint Pain,How is joint pain diagnosed?,"Your doctor will probably perform a physical exam. They’ll also ask you a series of questions about your joint pain. This may help to narrow down the potential causes. A jointX-raymay be necessary to identify arthritis-related joint damage. If your doctor suspects there’s another cause, they may order a blood test to screen for certain autoimmune disorders. They may also request a sedimentation rate test to measure the level of inflammation in the body or a complete blood count."
809,Joint Pain,How is joint pain treated?,"Doctors consider both OA and RA to be chronic conditions. There’s no treatment currently available that will completely eliminate the joint pain associated with arthritis or keep it from returning. However, there are ways to manage the pain: It may help to use topical pain relievers or take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs to reduce pain, swelling, and inflammation. Stayphysically activeand follow a fitness program focusing onmoderate exercise. Stretch before exercisingto maintain a good range of motion in your joints. Keep your body weight within ahealthy range. This will lessen stress on the joints. If your pain isn’t due to arthritis, you can try taking a nonprescription, anti-inflammatory drug,getting a massage, taking a warm bath, stretching frequently, and getting adequate rest. Your treatment options will depend on the cause of the pain. In some cases, your doctor will need to draw out accumulated fluid in the joint area to test for infection orgoutor other causes of the joint pain. They might also recommend surgery to replace the joint. Other nonsurgical treatment methods could include lifestyle changes or medications that can potentially cause your RA to go intoremission. In the case of RA, your doctor will first address inflammation. Once the RA goes into remission, your medical treatment will focus on keeping a tight rein on your condition so that you avoid flare-ups."
810,Joint Pain,What is the outlook for people with joint pain?,"Joint pain is often a result of the damage that occurs through normal wear and tear. However, it can also be a sign of an infection or potentially debilitating RA. You should see your doctor if you have any unexplained joint pain, especially if it doesn’t go away on its own after a few days. Early detection and diagnosis can allow for effective treatment of the underlying cause of your discomfort."
811,Kidney Stones,Overview,"Kidney stones, or renal calculi, are solid masses made of crystals. They can develop anywhere along your urinary tract, which consists of the kidneys, ureters, bladder, and urethra. Kidney stones can be a painful medical issue. The causes of kidney stones vary according to the type of stones. Not all kidney stones are made up of the same crystals. The different types of kidney stones include: Calcium stones are themost common. They’re often made ofcalcium oxalate, though they can consist of calcium phosphate or maleate. Eatingfewer oxalate-rich foodscan reduce your risk of developing this type of stone. High-oxalate foodsinclude: potato chips peanuts chocolate spinach However, even though some kidney stones are made of calcium, getting enough calcium in your diet can prevent stones from forming. This type of kidney stone is thesecond most common. They can occur in people withgout,diabetes,obesity, and other types ofmetabolic syndrome. This type of stone develops when urine is too acidic. A diet rich in purinescan increaseurine’s acidic level. Purine is a colorless substance in animal proteins, such as fish, shellfish, and meats. This type of stone is foundmostlyin people withurinary tract infections (UTIs). These stones can be large and cause urinary obstruction. Struvite stones result from akidney infection. Treating an underlying infection can prevent the development of struvite stones. About1 in 7,000people worldwide get cystine kidney stones. They occur in both men and women who have the genetic disordercystinuria. With this type of stone, cystine — an acid that occurs naturally in the body — leaks from the kidneys into the urine."
812,Kidney Stones,Symptoms and signs of a kidney stone,"Kidney stones can cause severe pain. Symptoms of kidney stones may not occur until the stone begins to move down theureters. This severe pain is calledrenal colic. Youmay havepain on one side of your back or abdomen. In men, pain may radiate to the groin area. The pain of renal colic comes and goes but can be intense. People with renal colic tend to be restless. Other symptoms of kidney stones caninclude: blood in the urine(red, pink, or brown urine) vomiting nausea discolored orfoul-smelling urine chills fever frequent need to urinate urinating small amounts of urine In the case of a small kidney stone, you may not have any pain or symptoms as the stone passes through your urinary tract."
813,Kidney Stones,Causes of kidney stones,"Kidney stones are most likely to occur in people between theages of 20 and 50. Different factors can increase your risk of developing a stone. In the United States,white peopleare more likely to have kidney stones than Black people. Sex also plays a role. More men than women develop kidney stones, according to theNational Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK). A history of kidney stones can increase your risk. So does a family history of kidney stones. Other risk factorsinclude: dehydration obesity a diet with high levels of protein, salt, or glucose hyperparathyroid condition gastric bypass surgery inflammatory bowel diseasesthat increase calcium absorption taking medications such as triamterenediuretics, antiseizure drugs, and calcium-based antacids"
814,Kidney Stones,How kidney stones are treated,"Treatment is tailored according to the type of stone. Urine can be strained and stones collected for evaluation. Drinking six to eight glasses of water a day increases urine flow. People who are dehydrated or have severenausea and vomitingmayneedintravenous fluids. Other treatment options include: Pain reliefmay requirenarcotic medications. The presence of infection requires treatment withantibiotics. Other medications include: allopurinol(Zyloprim) for uric acid stones thiazide diureticsto prevent calcium stones from forming sodium bicarbonate orsodium citrateto make the urine less acidic phosphorussolutions to prevent calcium stones from forming ibuprofen(Advil) for pain acetaminophen(Tylenol) for pain naproxensodium (Aleve) for pain Extracorporeal shock wavelithotripsyuses sound waves to break up large stones so they can more easily pass down the ureters into your bladder. This procedure can be uncomfortable andmay requirelightanesthesia. It can cause bruising on the abdomen and back and bleeding around the kidney and nearby organs. A surgeonremovesthe stones through a small incision in your back. A person may need this procedure when: the stone causes obstruction and infection or is damaging the kidneys the stone has grown too large to pass pain can’t be managed When a stone is stuck in the ureter or bladder, your doctor may use an instrument called a ureteroscope to remove it. A small wire with a camera attached is inserted into the urethra and passed into the bladder. The doctor then uses a small cage to snag the stone and remove it. The stone is then sent to the laboratory for analysis. Passing a kidney stone can cause pain and discomfort. Your doctor may recommend taking an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen, to help reduce symptoms. For severe pain, your doctor may alsoprescribeanarcoticor inject an anti-inflammatory medication, such as ketorolac (Toradol). Other natural remedies may also provide short-term relief from symptoms, including taking a hot bath or shower or applying a heating pad to the affected area."
815,Kidney Stones,Testing for and diagnosing kidney stones,"Diagnosis of kidney stones requires a complete health history assessment and aphysical exam. Other testsinclude: blood tests for calcium, phosphorus, uric acid, and electrolytes blood urea nitrogen (BUN)and creatinine to assess kidney functioning urinalysisto check for crystals, bacteria, blood, and white cells examination of passed stones to determine their type The following tests can rule out obstruction: abdominal X-rays intravenous pyelogram (IVP) retrograde pyelogram ultrasoundof the kidney (the preferred test) MRI scanof the abdomen and kidneys abdominal CT scan The contrast dye used in the CT scan and the IVP can affect kidney function. However, in people with normal kidney function, this isn’t a concern. There are some medications that can increase the potential for kidney damage in conjunction with the dye. Make sure your radiologist knows about any medications you’re taking."
816,Kidney Stones,Passing a kidney stone,"Passing a kidney stone is a process that typically occurs in stages over a period of several weeks. Here are the stages thatoccurwhen passing a kidney stone: Stage 1.After a kidney stone has formed, you may experience spasms as your kidneys try to push out the stone. This can cause severe pain in your back or side, which may come and go in waves. Stage 2.During this stage, the stone enters the ureter, which is the tube that connects the kidneys to the bladder. Depending on the size of the stone, this stage can also cause feelings of pain and intense pressure. Stage 3.Once the stone has reached the bladder, most of the pain will subside. However, you may feel an increased pressure in the bladder and a need to urinate more frequently. In some cases, the stone may temporarily get stuck at the opening of the urethra, which could block the flow of urine. Stage 4.The final stage occurs once the stone has reached the urethra. During this stage, you need to push hard to pass the kidney stone with the urine through the opening of the urethra. The amount of time that it takes to pass a kidney stone can vary depending on the size of the stone. Generally, small stones are able to pass through the urine within1-2 weeks, often without any treatment. On the other hand, larger stones may take 2-3 weeks to move through the kidneys and into the bladder. Stones that don’t pass on their own within 4 weeks typically require medical treatment."
817,Kidney Stones,How to prevent kidney stones,"Proper hydration is a key preventive measure. It’s recommended to drink enough fluid to pass at least2.5 litersof urine each day. Increasing the amount of urine you pass helps flush the kidneys. You can substitute ginger ale, lemon-lime soda, and fruit juice for water to help you increase your fluid intake. If the stones are related to low citrate levels, citratejuicescould help prevent the formation of stones. Eating oxalate-rich foods in moderation and reducing your intake of salt and animal proteins can also lower your risk of kidney stones. Your doctor may prescribe medications to help prevent the formation of calcium and uric acid stones. If you’ve had a kidney stone or you’re at risk for a kidney stone, speak with your doctor and discuss the best methods of prevention."
818,Kidney Stones,Foods that can cause kidney stones,"In addition to drinking more water, making modifications to your diet could also help prevent kidney stones. Here are some foods that you may need tolimitor avoid: beef chicken pork organ meats fish shellfish eggs milk cheese yogurt processed meats fast food frozen meals salty snacks Animal proteins like meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy products can increase levels of uric acid in your urine and increase the risk of developing kidney stones."
819,Kidney Stones,When to see a doctor,"In many cases, small kidney stones can pass on their own and don’t require any treatment. If you’re able to manage your pain with over-the-counter medications and don’t have any signs of infection or severe symptoms like nausea or vomiting, you may not need treatment. However, if you experience any of the following symptoms, you should seek immediate medical attention: blood in the urine fever chills cloudy or foul-smelling urine vomiting severe pain in your back or side pain or burning when you urinate difficulty urinating If you’re unable to see your doctor, you should go to the emergency room to receive treatment. If you have recurrent kidney stones, you should talk to your doctor, even if your symptoms resolve without treatment. Your doctor can helpdevelop a planto prevent kidney stones from forming and protect against long-term complications. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
820,Kidney Stones,Takeaway,"Although kidney stones can be a painful and frustrating issue to deal with, there are several different treatment options available. In fact, there are many medications and procedures that can help manage symptoms and promote the passage of kidney stones. Additionally, staying well-hydrated and making changes to your diet can prevent kidney stones from forming in the long run."
821,Leg Pain,Overview,"Your legs can hurt from minor injuries or overuse, but this can also indicate a serious medical condition. Home remedies may help, but seek medical advice if the pain persists. Leg pain can be dull or sharp. See your doctor if you’re experiencing severe or persistent leg pain. Getting a prompt diagnosis and treatment for any underlying conditions may prevent the pain from getting worse and improve your long-term outlook. Some of the more common causes of leg pain are minor or temporary conditions that your doctor can treat effectively."
822,Leg Pain,Cramps,"A primary cause of leg pain is a muscle cramp or spasm that’s often known as “a charley horse.” A cramp usually triggers sudden, sharp pain as the leg muscles contract. The tightening muscles often form a visible, hard lump beneath the skin. There may be some redness and swelling in the surrounding area. Muscle fatigue and dehydration may lead to leg cramps, especially in the calf. Certain medications, including diuretics and statins, may also cause leg cramps in some people."
823,Leg Pain,Injuries,"Leg pain is also frequently a sign of injury, such as the following: Muscle strainis a common injury that happens when the muscle fibers tear as a result of overstretching. It often occurs in the larger muscles, such as the hamstrings, calves, or quadriceps. Tendinitisis inflammation of a tendon. Tendons are thick cords that join the muscles to bone. When they become inflamed, it can be difficult to move the affected joint. Tendinitis often affects tendons in the hamstrings or near the heel bone. Knee bursitis happens when the fluid-filled sacs, or bursa, surrounding the knee joint become inflamed. Shin splintscause pain along the inner edge of the shinbone, or tibia. The injury can occur when the muscles around the shinbone tear as a result of overuse. Stress fractures are tiny breaks in the leg bones, particularly those in the shinbone."
824,Leg Pain,Medical conditions,"Certain medical conditions commonly lead to leg pain. These include: Atherosclerosisis the narrowing and hardening of the arteries due to a buildup of fat and cholesterol. Arteries are the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood throughout your body. When there’s a blockage, it reduces blood flow to various parts of your body. If the tissues in the leg don’t receive enough oxygen, it can result in leg pain, particularly in the calves. Deep vein thrombosis (DVT)occurs when a blood clot forms in a vein located deep inside the body. A blood clot is a clump of blood that’s in a solid state. DVTs typically form in the lower leg after long periods of bed rest, causing swelling and cramping pain. Arthritisis an inflammation of the joints. The condition may cause swelling, pain, and redness in the affected area. It often affects joints in the knees and hips. Goutis a form of arthritis that can occur when too much uric acid builds up in the body. It usually causes pain, swelling, and redness in the feet and lower part of the legs. Varicose veinsare knotted and enlarged veins that form when the veins overfill with blood due to incompetent valves. They usually appear swollen or raised and can be painful. They most often occur in the calves and ankles. Infection in the bone or tissues of the leg can cause swelling, redness, or pain in the affected area. Nerve damage in the leg may cause numbness, pain, or tingling. It often occurs in the feet and lower part of the legs as a result ofdiabetes."
825,Leg Pain,Other causes of leg pain,"The following conditions and injuries can also lead to leg pain, but they’re less common causes: Aslipped (herniated) diskoccurs when one of the rubbery disks in between the vertebrate slips out of place. The disk can compress nerves in the spine. This may trigger pain that travels from your spine to your arms and legs. Osgood-Schlatter diseaseoccurs when the tendon that connects the kneecap to the shinbone becomes strained. It pulls on the cartilage of tibia where it attaches to the bone. It causes a painful lump to form below the knee, resulting in tenderness and swelling around the knee. It primarily occurs in adolescents experiencing growth spurts during puberty. Legg-Calve-Perthes diseaseoccurs due to an interruption of the blood supply to the ball of the hip joint. The lack of blood supply severely damages the bone and can deform it permanently. These abnormalities often result in pain, especially around the hip, thigh, or knee. This primarily occurs during adolescence. Slipped capital femoral epiphysis is a separation of the ball of the hip joint from the thighbone, causing hip pain. The condition only occurs in children, particularly those who are overweight. Noncancerous, or benign, tumors can also develop in the thighbone or shinbone. Malignant, or cancerous, bone tumors may form in the larger leg bones, such as the thighbone or shinbone."
826,Leg Pain,Treating leg pain at home,"You can usually treat leg pain at home if it’s due to cramps or a minor injury. Try the following home treatments when your leg pain is frommuscle cramps, fatigue, or overuse: Rest your leg as much as possible, and elevate your leg with pillows. Take an over-the-counter pain reliever, such as aspirin or ibuprofen, to help ease discomfort as your leg heals. Wearcompression socks or stockingswith support. Apply ice to the affected area of your leg at least four times per day. You can do this even more frequently in the first few days after the pain appears. You can leave the ice on for as long as 15 minutes at a time. Take a warm bath, and then gently stretch your muscles. If you have pain in the lower part of your leg, try pointing and straightening your toes when sitting or standing. If you have pain in the upper part of your leg, try to bend over and touch your toes. You can do this while sitting on the ground or standing up. Ease into each stretch, holding each position for five to 10 seconds. Stop stretching if your pain gets worse."
827,Leg Pain,When to see your doctor about leg pain,It can sometimes be difficult to determine when leg pain warrants a trip to the doctor or the emergency room. Schedule a doctor’s appointment if you’re experiencing: swelling in both legs varicose veins that are causing discomfort pain while walking leg pain that continues to get worse or persists beyond a few days Go to the hospital immediately if any of the follow occurs: You have a fever. You have a deep cut on your leg. Your leg is red and warm to the touch. Your leg is pale and feels cool to the touch. You’re having difficulty breathing and you have swelling in both legs. You’re unable to walk or put any weight on your leg. You have a leg injury that occurred along with a pop or grinding noise. A number of serious conditions and injuries may cause leg pain. Never ignore leg pain that doesn’t seem to be going away or that’s accompanied by other symptoms. Doing so could be dangerous. See your doctor if you’re concerned about your leg pain.
828,Leg Pain,Preventing leg pain,"You should always take time to stretch your muscles before and after exercising to prevent leg pain due to physical activity. It’s also helpful to eat foods that are high in potassium, such as bananas and chicken, to help prevent injuries of the leg muscles and tendons. You can help prevent medical conditions that may cause nerve damage in the legs by doing the following: Exercise for 30 minutes per day, five days per week. Maintain a healthy weight. Avoid smoking. Monitor your cholesterol and blood pressure, and take steps to keep them under control. Limit your alcohol consumption to one drink per day if you’re a woman or two drinks per day if you’re a man. Talk to your doctor about other ways to prevent the specific cause of your leg pain."
829,Lice,Overview,"What are lice? The louse (plural: lice) is a parasite that attaches itself to human hair and feeds on human blood. The most prevalent kind of lice is head lice. An infestation with head lice is medically known asPediculosis capitis.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimate thatup to 12 million lice infestationsoccur every year in the United States. Female adult lice can lay up to six eggs every day. Eggs are laid right onto the shaft of hair. Those that are less than six millimeters from the scalp are most likely to hatch. The eggs are essentially glued on to the hair by secretions from the female louse. The eggs take about a week to hatch, producing a nymph. The nymphs then go through three successive growth spurts. During these spurts, they molt until they reach adult size. Adult lice are about the size of a sesame seed and can be very hard to see, because they can be any color from white to tan to brown. Lice typically feed on blood four to five times each day. They use their mouth parts to bite into the skin and secrete a substance that acts to block clotting. While it’s important to note that lice infestations can happen to anyone, some people are at a higher risk of coming into contact with lice. Learn more: What do lice look like? »"
830,Lice,Types of lice,"Common types of lice include head lice, body lice, and pubic lice. Head lice are obligate parasites. This means that they cannot survive without a human host. This species can live only on human hosts, so you cannot get them from your dog, cat, guinea pig, or any other kind of furry pet you may have. Lice don’t have wings, so they can’t fly. They have six legs with claws at the ends — that’s how they attach themselves to hair. Head lice can settle anywhere on the scalp, but they’re commonly found on hairs at the back of the neck and around the ears, where it’s warmest. Body lice are slightly different from head lice because they lay their eggs on clothing instead of on the body. Body lice also live in clothing and only move onto the body to feed. Body lice can carry a number of diseases, such as: louse-borne typhus relapsing fever trench fever Body lice are the only kind of lice known to spread disease. Pubic lice are a species of lice with large front legs, making them resemble crabs underneath a microscope. They are the smallest type of lice. Pubic lice are nicknamed “crabs” and are usually transmitted from one person to another during sexual activity. They live in the hair of their host’s genital area and can cause itching."
831,Lice,How do lice spread?,"Lice infestations can happen to anyone, but they are a particular concern for school-age children. It’s important to emphasize that poor hygiene — such as skipped baths or showers or any other hygiene issue — is not typically the cause of head lice. Children who live in crowded conditions may have more of a problem with head lice. This is only because they’re living close to one another and may sleep in the same bed. There are only two ways head lice can spread from person to person. One is by direct head-to-head contact, as when children hug or put their heads together to look at the same book. The other way is by sharing hats, caps, hair ties, scarves, or any personal item such as combs or brushes. Body lice are spread by lice living on unwashed clothing. Unlike other kinds of lice, the spread of body lice can be prevented fairly simply. Clothes should be washed often after wearing, and you should avoid sharing clothing with others. Pubic lice (“crabs”) are spread through sexual activity. Children that contract pubic lice may be victims of sexual abuse."
832,Lice,Treating lice,"There are a number of treatments that can effectively get rid of head lice. These include over-the-counter products,natural remedies, and prescription medications. However, it is important to note that there are no natural or alternative products recommended by the CDC for the treatment of lice. Getting rid of lice completely involves three steps. No matter what kind of lice you have, the treatment process is essentially the same: Kill the lice. Kill and remove the eggs. Decontaminate any affected areas and clothing. The most common treatment product for lice involves pediculicide shampoo. After applying this treatment to the affected area, hair should not be washed for up to two days. You can use a special comb called a “nit comb” to carefully remove the eggs that have attached themselves to the hair shaft. You should thoroughly vacuum any area of your home where hairs might have fallen. Any bedding or clothing that has been exposed to the lice needs to be machine washed in hot water. You may wish to avoid the use of lice medications on yourself or your small children. Some natural products promise the same results as pediculicides. However, these “holistic” products are not regulated by the Food and Drug Administration. A natural product that is not regulated may carry its own risks, especially in small children. It’s also important to remember that these products may not be as effective as promised.Some studieshave shown that essential oils may have a role in lice treatment. If you have lice, you may find relief with the following oils: tea tree oil eucalyptus oil neem oil lavender oil Lice seem to be building resistance to some commonly used products. The American Council of Science and Healthreportsthat in certain areas of the United States, traditional lice treatment products are no longer as effective at getting rid of infestations. There are already products on the market, such as those containing ivermectin, that treat these so-called “super lice.” These stronger products require a doctor’s prescription."
833,Lice,Preventing lice,"There is no proven product or method that will completely eliminate the spread of lice, but there are steps you can take to lower your chances of getting it. Avoid head-to-head contact with other people whenever possible. Never share personal hygiene products, especially combs or brushes. Try to avoid “hot spots” such as shared locker spaces, coat hooks, and closets in public places. Tell your school-aged children about lice and the steps they can take to help minimize the risk of contracting it. Occasionally, an allergy to lice feces will lead to a rash and additional discomfort in the affected person. Continuous scratching of an area (to relieve itching) can lead to breaking the skin barrier and, subsequently, an infection in that area. In rare cases, lice living on eyelashes can lead to eye inflammation and pinkeye. Sometimes the very idea of lice can lead to stress and sleepless nights for children and parents. If lice eggs aren’t destroyed properly during the initial treatment, or if you have repeated contact with a person who has not treated their lice infestation completely, you may find yourself experiencing repeated infestations. If this occurs, you should repeat the entire treatment seven days from your initial treatment date."
834,Lice,Takeaway,"Remember that getting lice is not a reflection on a person’s personal hygiene. While treating lice is generally never a pleasant experience, it’s fairly straightforward. Your life will most likely be lice-free again quickly."
835,Low Testosterone,Overview,"Testosterone is a hormone that plays a role in puberty, fertility, and libido. Low levels may cause physical symptoms or mood changes. Treatment options, such as increased exercise or medication, could help boost your levels. In this article, we use “assigned male at birth” and “assigned female at birth” to refer to someone’s sex as determined by their chromosomes, and “men” and “women” when referring to their gender (unless quoting from sources using nonspecific language). Sex is determined by chromosomes, and gender is a social construct that can vary between time periods and cultures. Both of these aspects are acknowledged to exist on a spectrum both historically and by modern scientific consensus. In people assigned male at birth, mosttestosteroneis made in the testes. In people assigned female at birth, most testosterone is made in the ovaries. People assigned male at birth have higher levels of testosterone than people assigned female at birth. Testosteroneinfluences the developmentof many physical characteristics. It helps increase muscle bulk, bone mass, physical strength, and body hair. The levels of testosterone in your body are constantly changing in response to your body’s needs. However, the overall level of testosterone in your body changes throughout your lifetime as well. Typically, testosterone decreases as you age — particularly in people assigned male at birth. For some people, these levels can become too low and cause unwanted effects that have them looking for ways to increase their testosterone levels."
836,Low Testosterone,What is a testosterone test?,"In order to know whethertestosterone levelsare too low, a normal level has to be established. This has been a challenge for clinicians. However, according to apress releasefrom the Endocrine Society in January 2017, results from arecent studyhave helped to define the normal ranges for testosterone levels in those assigned male at birth: 264–916 nanograms per deciliter (ng/dL). This range is for those assigned male at birth between the ages of 19 and 39 years who don’t have obesity. Atestosterone testmeasures the amount of testosterone in your blood. If a doctor wants to test the hormone levels in your blood, they’ll most likely specify a time of day for your test. Hormone levels are highest in the morning, so this test is often performed in the morning between 7:00 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. Your doctor may have your levels tested more than once. Your doctor may ask you to stop taking certain drugs before your test, as they could affect your testosterone levels. It’s important to tell your doctor about all medications you’re taking. Include both over-the-counter and prescription drugs. Testosterone home-testing kits are also available from companies such asLetsGetChecked. They use your saliva to test your hormone levels. After taking the test, you’ll send your sample to a lab for testing."
837,Low Testosterone,How to increase testosterone levels,"There may be certain lifestyle changes to helpincrease testosterone levels, such as adding resistance exercise and losing weight. Researchindicates that resistance exercise, such as lifting weights, is related to temporary increases in testosterone levels. Anolder 1999 studysuggests that testosterone increases after heavy resistance training are typically much higher in younger than older people assigned male at birth — and overall don’t appear to greatly increase your overall testosterone levels. Exercise, especiallycardiovascular exercise, can contribute to weight loss, which canhelp to increase levels of testosterone."
838,Low Testosterone,Treating low testosterone levels,"In addition to lifestyle changes and increased exercise, there are a few other options available to you that can help boost the amount of testosterone in your body. A few of these options have been proven in clinical trials. Others may claim to increase testosterone level but don’t always provide substantial evidence to back up their claims. Of course, if you’re concerned about you testosterone levels, it’s a good idea to share your concerns with a doctor. They’ll be able to verify your T levels and help build a treatment plan. Here are just a few of the most common ways to treat low testosterone levels. Some types of herbal supplements claim to be “testosterone boosters.” The makers of these products claim that the ingredients help to increase levels of testosterone. However, there isn’t enough research to support their effectiveness, and these productsmay not actuallyhave ingredients that support their claims. In fact, a2020 studytested 50 supplements advertised as “testosterone boosting” and “libido improving.” The researchers found that less than 25 percent of them had data to support their claims, based on their ingredients. Moreover, 10 percent of the supplements tested contained ingredients that have a negative effect on testosterone, according to the study. Additionally, these products aren’t closely regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that they aren’t tested or evaluated for their effectiveness and could contain undisclosed ingredients or have unexpected side effects. Consider talking with a doctor before taking a “testosterone booster” and discuss with them alternative treatments that are FDA-approved and clinically proven to work. You may find there are morenatural stepsthat may help to boost your testosterone level. Some foods may play a role in helping your bodymoderate your testosterone levels. Making sure you get enough foods that are rich inzinc and vitamin Dmay help to keep your testosterone at a normal level. Here areseven testosterone-boostingfoods that could help you get the vitamins and minerals you need to keep your testosterone levels healthy. A 2018 animal studysuggests that zinc supplementation increases testosterone and fertility in those with marginal zinc deficiency. Testosterone replacement therapyis used to help treat people with abnormally low levels of testosterone. Abnormally low levels of testosteronecan affectnormal body functions. They may contribute to decreased muscle mass, a lowered sex drive, erectile dysfunction (ED), and mood changes such as irritability and depression. Testosterone replacement therapy involves taking prescribed testosterone medication in the form of pills, patches, and gel that you apply to your skin. Testosterone therapy can also come in the form of injections. Testosterone injectionsare one of the more common forms of testosterone replacement therapy. They’re typically given by a doctor. You need them less frequently than other forms."
839,Low Testosterone,Side effects of testosterone replacement therapy,"Testosterone replacement therapy has many risks. If you have testosterone replacement therapy, you’ll need frequent blood tests to check your testosterone levels and to monitor potential side effects,including: fluid retainment acne prostate enlargement lowered fertility sleep apnea blood clots increased red blood cells Side effects may vary based on the type of testosterone therapy you use."
840,Low Testosterone,Symptoms of low testosterone,"Symptoms of abnormally low testosteronecan be bothersome and may impact your quality of life. These symptoms can include: decreased body hair decreased muscle mass low sex drive ED growth of breast tissue If you’re experiencing one or more of these symptoms and don’t believe they’re caused by something else, talk with a doctor. If your doctor thinks your symptoms are related to abnormally low testosterone levels, they can test your levels. Testosterone levels in people assigned male at birthremain fairly constantfrom the start of puberty — when levels spike — until a person’s 30s, when they slowly begin to decline. For some people, testosterone levels may become abnormally low. Causes of low testosterone levelsinclude: aging delayed puberty testicular damage (caused by trauma, alcoholism, or mumps) hypothalamic disease pituitary disease noncancerous pituitary tumor chemotherapy A number of genetic diseases can also affect testosterone levels, including: Klinefelter syndrome Kallmann syndrome myotonic dystrophy Testosterone plays an important role in people assigned female at birth. However, testosterone levels are naturally lower in these individuals than in people assigned male at birth. Usually, low levels of testosterone in people assigned female at birth aren’t problematic. However, levels that are too high may cause unwanted symptoms. Theseinclude: irregular or absent menstrual periods infertility development of facial and body hair deepened voice High testosterone levels in people assigned female at birth may be caused by: polycystic ovarian syndrome congenital adrenocortical hyperplasia ovarian cancer or tumor adrenal tumor"
841,Low Testosterone,When to see a doctor,"According to the American Urological Association, you shouldsee a healthcare professionalif you have any of the following symptoms of low testosterone, including: lowered sex drive lowered erectile function fatigue lowered lean muscle mass irritability symptoms of depression It’s worth noting that ED can be a symptom of low T levels, but there isn’t a strong correlation showing that testosterone replacement can also treat ED. If you’re experiencing ED, it’s worth talking with a doctor. They can confirm if low T levels are the cause of your ED symptoms or help you explore other alternative treatments that might work better for you."
842,Low Testosterone,Frequently asked questions about low testosterone,"It’s common for people assigned male at birth to experience drops in their testosterone levels as they age. However, if these levels are significantly low, there can be a number of short-term and long-term symptoms that someone might experience. Some of the most apparentsymptoms of low testosteronecould include ED, lowered sex drive, depression, difficulties focusing on tasks, and an increase in body weight. More long-term symptoms that might develop from untreated low testosterone levels could be a loss of muscle mass and acondition that weakens your bonesknown asosteoporosis. Potential benefitsof testosterone therapy for people with low testosterone include: increased libido improved sexual function improved mood and well-being increased muscle mass increased bone density There’sconflicting evidenceregarding the benefits of male testosterone therapy for age-related declines in testosterone, according to a2017 clinical review. Somestudiesshow improvement in ED in older men, while others don’t. There’s no evidence that testosterone therapy improves ED in men with normal testosterone levels. Testosterone therapy does appear to increase bone density in the lumbar spine in middle-aged men with testosterone deficiency. It also consistently increases lean mass while decreasing fat mass, but the effect sizes are small. Side effects of testosterone therapy can vary for people based on their sex assigned at birth. Adverse effects of testosterone replacement therapy in people assigned male at birthmay include: acne erythrocytosis (when you have more red blood cells than normal) lowered sperm production increased risk of subclinical prostate cancer Adverse effects of testosterone therapy in people assigned female at birthmay include: acne extra hair growth weight gain fluid retention shifts in mood anger or hostility In rare circumstances, adverse effects may include: voice deepening baldness clitoral enlargement In a2015 advisory,the FDA warned that testosterone use is possibly associated with increased cardiovascular risk. However,other reviews of studiesdidn’t find an increased risk. For now, the effects of testosterone therapy on cardiovascular health remain unclear, but studies are ongoing. Fully replenishing your testosterone level depends largely on what treatments you explore a your doctor. If you choose to go a more natural route with changes to your diet and exercise routine, you may see an increase in your T levels, but it’s highly unlikely that you’ll be able to get back to the levels you were at in your 20s with diet, exercise, and supplements alone. Testosterone creams and injections can replace a significant amount of lost testosterone, but since each person reacts differently to these treatments, it’s possible that your T levels won’t be fully replenished. More importantly, it’s worth discussing the side effects and results of overusing these replacement therapies. You should never increase your dose or the frequency of use without talking with a doctor first.Severe side effectsfrom misusing these treatments can include stroke, heart attack, a higher risk of prostate cancer, liver conditions, and an enlarged prostate."
843,Low Testosterone,Takeaway,"Testosterone levels in people assigned male at birth decrease a little naturally with age. However, in some people, these levels can be too low and cause unwanted symptoms. Treatment is available, but it’s important for your doctor to confirm your low testosterone levels with one or more blood tests. Your doctor may also do other tests to help determine what’s causing your low testosterone. For people assigned female at birth, levels of testosterone that are too high, rather than too low, are more concerning. Symptoms of high testosterone may be an indication of an underlying condition that needs to be treated."
844,Lung Cancer,Overview,"Lung cancer is a cancer that starts in the lungs and can spread to other areas of the body. The symptoms, outlook, and treatment depend on the stage of cancer and how far it has spread. Lung cancer is the leading cause ofcancerdeaths in the United States. Early symptoms of lung cancer can be subtle, but the sooner it is diagnosed, the better your treatment options and possible outcomes. Doctors primarily treat lung cancer with surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Newer treatments include immunotherapy and targeted therapy. Read on to learn more about lung cancer and the current and evolving treatment options."
845,Lung Cancer,What are the signs of lung cancer?,"The symptoms of lung cancer depend on the type and stage of your cancer: The early stages of lung cancer don’t alwayscause symptoms. Whenearly symptomsdo occur, they can include shortness of breath as well as unexpected symptoms, such as back pain. Back pain can occur when tumors cause pressure in your lungs or when they spread to your spinal cord and ribs. Other early signs of lung cancer may include: a lingering or worseningcough coughing up phlegm orblood chest painthat worsens when you breathe deeply, laugh, or cough hoarseness wheezing weakness and fatigue loss of appetite and weight loss recurrent respiratory infections such aspneumoniaorbronchitis Additional symptoms of lung cancer depend on where new tumors form. Not everyone with late-stage lung cancer will experience every symptom. Late-stage symptoms might include: lumps in yourneckor collarbone bonepain, especially in your back, ribs, or hips headaches dizziness balance issues numbness in arms or legs yellowing of skin and eyes (jaundice) drooping of one eyelid and shrunken pupils lack of perspiration on one side of your face shoulder pain swelling of your face and upper body Additionally, lung cancer tumors can sometimes release hormones, leading to a wide variety of symptoms known asparaneoplastic syndrome. Symptoms include: muscle weakness nausea and vomiting high blood pressure high blood sugar confusion seizures"
846,Lung Cancer,What are the different types of lung cancer?,"There are severaldifferent typesof lung cancer. Most types of lung cancer are either non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) or small-cell lung cancer (SCLC). However, some people have tumors that contain both kinds of cells. Non-small cell lung cancer(NSCLC):NSCLC makes up about80–85%of all cases. There are several types of NSCLC. Most types of NSCLC respond well to treatment if caught in the early stages.Squamous cell lung carcinoma:About30%of all cases of NSCLC begin in the cells that line the passages of your respiratory tract. This is called squamous cell carcinoma.Adenocarcinomas:This type usually forms in the outer part of your lungs.Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS):This rare subset of adenocarcinoma begins in the tiny air sacs in your lungs. It’s not aggressive and may not need immediate treatment.Adenosquamous carcinoma:This cancer develops in a mixture of squamous cells and mucus-producing cells.Large cell carcinoma:Large cell carcinoma is a fast-growing group of NSCLCs that does not classify under other cancer types. Squamous cell lung carcinoma:About30%of all cases of NSCLC begin in the cells that line the passages of your respiratory tract. This is called squamous cell carcinoma. Adenocarcinomas:This type usually forms in the outer part of your lungs.Adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS):This rare subset of adenocarcinoma begins in the tiny air sacs in your lungs.

Large cell carcinoma:Large cell carcinoma is a fast-growing group of NSCLCs that does not classify under other cancer types. Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC):About15–20%percent of lung cancers are SCLC. This type of lung cancer is more aggressive than NSCLC. Although SCLC often initially responds better to chemotherapy, it is less likely to be cured than NSCLC. Mesothelioma: This type of lung cancer has links with asbestos exposure. It occurs when carcinoid tumors start in hormone-producing (neuroendocrine) cells.Mesotheliomais aggressive and fast-growing. It does not respond well to treatment. Learn how lung cancer type can affect survival rates."
847,Lung Cancer,What are the stages of lung cancer?,"Cancer stages tell how far cancer has spread and help guide treatment. The chance of successful or curative treatment is much higher when lung cancer is diagnosed and treated early. Because lung cancer may not cause obvious symptoms in the earlier stages, people usually receive a diagnosis after it has spread. Hidden (occult):For unknown reasons, doctors cannot identify the tumor, but cancer cells are visible in sputum or other fluid tests. Testing also suggests the cancer has not spread to nearby lymph nodes or other places. Stage 0:The cancer is only present in the epithelial layer of cells covering the airway, with no evidence that it has gone deeper into the lung tissues, nearby lymph nodes, or any other parts of the body. Stage 1:Cancer is found in the lungs but has not spread to the lymph nodes or anywhere else. Stage 2:Cancer is in the lung and nearby lymph nodes. Stage 3:Cancer is in the lung and lymph nodes in the middle of the chest. .Stage 4:Cancer has spread to both lungs, into the area around the lungs, or to distant organs. All of these stagescan divide into substages depending on the type of tumor, its size, and the specific structures it affects. There are two stages of SCLC:limited and extensive. In the limited stage, cancer is found in only one lung or nearby lymph nodes on the same side of the chest. The extensive stage means cancer has spread: throughout one lung to the opposite lung to lymph nodes on the opposite side to fluid around the lung to bone marrow to distant organs About2 out of 3 peoplewith SCLC are already in the extensive stage when they receive a diagnosis."
848,Lung Cancer,What is the life expectancy for lung cancer?,"The following are the estimated5-year survival ratesfor NSCLC and SCLC by SEER stage: Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is very aggressive. Depending on how far the cancer has spread, the relative 5-year survival rate for mesothelioma is7–24%. Keep in mind that survival rates and other statistics provide a broad picture of what to expect. There are significant individual differences, and your doctor is in the best position to discuss your outlook. Learn more about the prognosis for non-small cell lung cancer."
849,Lung Cancer,How is lung cancer screened and diagnosed?,"The U.S. Preventative Task Force (USPSTF)recommends people ages 50–80 years who currently smoke or those who have quit in the last 15 years undergo screening for lung cancer. The screening is usually done with a low dose computed tomography (CT), though your doctor may want to conduct other imaging tests such asX-ray,MRI, andPET scans, which can also show an abnormal mass in your lungs. In addition, they may conduct the following tests: Sputum cytology:If you produce phlegm when you cough, a microscopic examination can determine if cancer cells are present. Bronchoscopy:While under sedation, doctors pass alighted tubedown your throat and into your lungs, allowing closer examination of your lung tissue. Thoracentesis:If there is fluid in your lungs, this procedure can remove some of the fluid to see if the cancer has spread to the lining of your lungs. Lung needlebiopsy:This involves obtaining a small sample of lung tissue, which is then examined under a microscope to see if tumor cells are cancerous. Your doctor inserts a needle through the chest wall and into the suspicious lung tissue. There are various sub-types of this procedure depending on your specific needs. If the biopsy results are positive for cancer, you might need additional testing, such as abone scan,to help determine if the cancer has spread and to help with staging. Learn more about how doctors diagnose lung cancer."
850,Lung Cancer,How is lung cancer treated?,"The primarytreatmentsfor lung cancer include surgery to remove the tumor and chemotherapy and radiation treatments to kill cancer cells. Sometimes, doctors use newer cancer treatments such as targeted therapy and immunotherapy, but usually not until later stages. As a rule, treatment for NSCLC varies from person to person. Your treatment plan will depend on specific details of your health and at what stage you received a diagnosis. Treatment options for NSCLC by stage typically include: Stage 1 NSCLC:Surgery to remove a portion of the lung may be all you need. Your doctor may also recommend chemotherapy, especially if you’re at high risk of recurrence. Cancer is most treatable if caught at this stage. Stage 2 NSCLC:You may needsurgeryto remove part or all of your lung. Your doctor will usually recommend chemotherapy. Stage 3 NSCLC:You may require a combination of chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation treatment. Stage 4 NSCLC:Options include surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy. The options for SCLC also include surgery,chemotherapy, and radiation therapy. In most cases, the cancer will be too advanced for surgery. If you’re diagnosed with lung cancer, it’s likely that a team of doctors will manage your care, including: a surgeon who specializes in the chest and lungs (thoracic surgeon) a lung specialist (pulmonologist) a medical oncologist a radiation oncologist Discuss all your treatment options before making a decision. Your doctors will coordinate care and keep each other informed. You may also want to discuss clinical trials with your doctor. Clinical trialscan provide access to promising new treatments and can be an option if your treatment plan has stalled. Some people with advanced lung cancer choose not to continue treatment. You can still choosepalliative caretreatments, which focus on treating the symptoms of cancer rather than the cancer itself. Learn more about alternative treatments for lung cancer. Home remedies won’t cure cancer. However, some may help relieve symptoms associated with lung cancer or the side effects of treatment. Options may include: Massage:Massage can help relieve pain and anxiety. Some massage therapists have specific training to work with people with cancer. Acupuncture:When performed by a trained practitioner, acupuncture may help ease pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, it’s not safe if you have low blood counts or take blood thinners. Meditation:Relaxation and reflection may help reduce stress and improve overall quality of life. Yoga:Combining breathing techniques, meditation, and stretching, yoga can help you feel better overall and improve sleep. Cannabis oil:Some people claim thatcannabis oilreduces pain, relieves nausea and vomiting, and improves appetite. However, scientists need to do more research into these claims. Additionally, state laws on cannabis vary, so this option isn’t available nationwide. No diet can minimize lung cancer. However, it’s important to get all the nutrients your body needs. Cancer treatments can cause you to lose your appetite. They can also make it hard for your body to absorb vitamins. If you’re deficient in certain nutrients, your doctor can advise you on foods or supplements as necessary. Here are a few dietary tips: Eat whenever you have an appetite. If you don’t have an appetite, try eating smaller meals throughout the day. If you need to gain weight, supplement with low sugar, high calorie foods and drinks. Use mint andginger teasto soothe your digestive system. If your stomach is easily upset or you have mouth sores, avoid spicy food. If you have constipation, tryadding more high fiberfoods. As you progress through treatment, your tolerance to certain foods may change. So can the side effects you experience and your nutritional needs. It’s worth discussing nutrition with your doctor. You can also ask for a referral to a nutritionist or dietician. Here’s how to meet your dietary needs if you have lung cancer."
851,Lung Cancer,What causes lung cancer?,"Anyone can get lung cancer, but there are a few risk factors that make it a lot more likely. Smoke damages your lung tissue from the moment you inhale it. Once you have damage to your lung cells, they begin to behave abnormally. This increases your chance of lung cancer. Smoking is the single biggest risk factor for lung cancer. This includes cigarettes, cigars, and pipes. Tobacco products contain thousands of toxic substances. As many as90%of lung cancer cases are the result of smoking. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), cigarette smokers are 15–30 times more likely to get lung cancer than nonsmokers. While not all smokers get lung cancer, and not everyone who has lung cancer is a smoker, there’s no doubt that smoking is the biggest risk factor. Plus, you don’t have to be a smoker to be affected. Secondhand smoke also increases your risk of lung cancer. Every year in the United States, about7,300 peoplewho’ve never smoked die from lung cancer resulting from secondhand smoke. Former smokers are still at risk of developing lung cancer, but quitting can lower that risk considerably. Within 10 years ofquitting smoking, your chance of dying from lung cancerdrops by half. SCLC is almost always associated with heavy smoking. When you stop smoking, your lungs may be able to heal, reducing your risk of lung cancer. Exposure toradonis the second leading cause of lung cancer, according to theAmerican Lung Association. Your chance of lung cancer also increases by breathing in other hazardous substances such as: asbestos arsenic cadmium chromium nickel some petroleum products uranium Otherrisk factorsfor lung cancer include: Genetic mutations:Thisincludesthe TP53, EGFR, and KRAS, which can negatively affect cell growth, division, and repair. A family history of lung cancer:Having family members with lung cancer increases your chance of lung cancer. A personal history of lung cancer:You’re more likely to get lung cancer if you’ve had lung cancer in the past, especially if you’re a smoker. Previous radiation therapy to the chest:Radiation therapy can increase your risk of lung cancer."
852,Lung Cancer,What are the complications of lung cancer?,"Lung cancer can lead to complications. These include: High risk of infection:People with lung cancer have a higher chance of pneumonia, bronchitis, and other infections. Paraneoplastic syndromes:These are conditionsresultingfrom the immune system overreacting to the tumor. These can cause hypercalcemia (increased calcium in your blood), for example. This can also cause various types of brain inflammation. Facial swelling:Tumors in your lungs can restrict blood flow to your upper body and result in facial swelling. Loss of lung function:Shortness of breath, difficulty breathing, and other symptoms of reduced lung function can occur in lung cancer patients. Blood clots:People with lung cancer are at a higher risk ofclots,especially in their lower legs. Spitting up blood:Irritation in airways or from tumors can result in spitting up blood. Spinal compression:Tumors can press on the spine and cause pain, weakness, and trouble walking. Heart blockage:Tumors in your lungs can compress heart vessels and lead to multiple serious heart conditions. Nerve pain:Tumors can result in nerve pain along with numbness, tingling, and weakness. Trouble swallowing:Lung cancer can spread to your esophagus and cause trouble swallowing. Neutropenia:This is when your blood doesn’t have enough neutrophils, a type of white blood cell that helps protect you from infection. Kidney dysfunction:This can happen as a result of certain medications."
853,Lung Cancer,Can you prevent lung cancer?,"There is no guaranteed way to prevent lung cancer. However, you can reduce your risk if you: Quit smoking: Smoking is the number-one risk factor for lung cancer. Eliminating smoking greatly reduces your chance of developing lung cancer. Avoid radon:You can have your home tested for radon to help reduce your exposure and lung cancer risk. Avoid other cancer-causing chemicals:Limiting your exposure to other cancer-causing chemicals can reduce your risk. Eat a healthy diet: There is someevidenceto suggest that eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce your chance of lung cancer."
854,Lung Cancer,Is lung cancer usually fatal?,"Lung cancer is most treatable when you catch it early. Unfortunately, the early stages of lung cancer don’t always cause symptoms. Your outlook depends on the type and stage of your cancer, as well as factors such as your age at diagnosis, overall health, and how well your cancer responds to treatment. As a rule, the earlier your cancer is diagnosed, the better it will respond to treatment. In recent years,new treatmentshave gained approval for stage 4 NSCLC. Some people are surviving much longer than previously seen with traditional treatments."
855,Lung Cancer,How do people cope with lung cancer?,"Treatments for lung cancer can be tricky. Options such as chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy all come with potential side effects that are hard to manage. Additionally, the stigma of having lung cancer often causes self-blame, mental health issues, and reduced quality of life. To boost your ability to cope with these issues, it’s important to use strategies like quitting smoking, eating a healthy diet, and seeking out support networks. Don’t be afraid to ask your care team about anything you don’t understand — it’s perfectly reasonable to get a second opinion at any point during your journey. It’s also beneficial to lean on family and friends for assistance with things like cleaning the house, running errands, taking you to appointments, and just engaging in enjoyable activities not related to cancer. You may find that connecting with patient advocacy groups or learning how to advocate for yourself helps ease some of the difficulties associated with managing your care. Participating in mind-body therapies or hobbies may reduce stress and increase overall well-being. Moreover, if you are experiencing anxiety or depression, then it may help to reach out to your doctor for counseling or medication. The ALA providesresources for finding support groupsand other helpful advice."
856,Lung Cancer,Takeaway,"Lung cancer begins in your lungs and can spread to other parts of the body. Your prognosis and treatment will depend on the type of cancer you have and the stage you’re diagnosed with. Treatment often includes surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation. Newer treatments are helping increase survival odds for lung cancer patients, and participating in a clinical trial could offer promise when other treatments stall. There is no guaranteed way to prevent lung cancer, but by quitting smoking and avoiding hazardous exposures, you can dramatically reduce your chance of developing lung cancer."
857,Lyme Disease,Overview,"Lyme disease progresses through stages, each with distinct symptoms, though individual experiences can vary. Early symptoms may include a bull’s-eye rash, fever, and fatigue, while later stages can involve systemic infection affecting the heart, nervous system, and joints. Diagnosis involves a physical exam and possibly blood tests, but the CDC does not recommend tick testing. Early treatment with oral antibiotics is typically effective, while later stages may require intravenous antibiotics. Preventing Lyme disease centers on avoiding tick bites by using repellents, wearing protective clothing, and checking for ticks after being outdoors. Although most people recover fully with treatment, some may experience post-Lyme disease syndrome. Lyme disease was first recognized in the town of Old Lyme, Connecticut, in 1975. It’s an infectious disease caused by the bacterium Borrelia burgdorferi and, in rare cases, Borrelia mayonii. B. burgdorferiistransmitted to humansby a bite from an infected black-legged tick, also known as a deer tick. These tiny insects become infected after feeding on infected animals, such as deer, birds, or mice. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), infected ticks transmit Lyme disease in the Northeastern, Mid-Atlantic, and North Central United States, as well as on the Pacific Coast of the United States. Keep reading to learn more about the symptoms and treatments for Lyme disease and how to identify a tick bite."
858,Lyme Disease,Stages of Lyme disease,Lyme disease is typically classified intothree stages. These help categorize the severity and development of symptoms and the infection. (1) Early localized:This stage occurs 1–28 days after thetick bite. (2) Early disseminated:This stage may develop 3–12 weeks after the tick bite. (3) Late disseminated:This is the most advanced stage of Lyme disease. It may take months or years to develop.
859,Lyme Disease,Signs and symptoms of Lyme disease,"Symptoms of Lyme diseasevary depending on the stage of infection. That said, the severity, progression, and presentation of symptoms may vary depending on the individual. For example, symptoms of stages 1 and 2 may overlap. Or, you may not experience any stage 1 symptoms but experience later symptoms. Symptoms of Lyme disease usually start3–30 daysafter the tick bite. One of the earliest signs of the disease is abull’s-eye rash, also known as an erythema migrans. Up to8 out of 10 peopleexperience a bull’s eye rash, which occurs at the site of the tick bite. It usually has a central red spot surrounded by a clear spot with an area of redness at the edge. People with lighter skin may have arashthat’s solid red, while people with darker skin may have a rash that resembles a bruise. It may be warm to the touch, but it’s not painful and doesn’t itch. Other symptoms commonly seen in stage 1 of Lyme diseaseinclude: chills fever enlarged lymph nodes sore throat vision changes fatigue muscle aches headaches Early disseminated Lyme diseasecan appearup to 3 monthsafter the tick bite, while late disseminated Lyme disease may take up to 12 months. Stages 2 and 3 of Lyme disease are characterized bysystemic infection. This means the infection has spread throughout your body, including to other organs. Symptoms mayinclude: abnormal heart rhythm, which can be caused byLyme carditis neurologic conditions, such asfacial palsiesandcranial neuropathy multiple erythema migrans lesions on your body numbness, tingling, and pain in your hands and feet severe headaches neck stiffness meningitis arthritisof one or more large joints, typically the knee encephalopathy, which may cause short-term memory loss, difficulty concentrating,mental fogginess, problems with following conversations, and sleep disturbance It’s important to note that you may experience later symptoms of Lyme disease without experiencing earlier symptoms, such as a bull’s eye rash. Children generally experience the same Lyme disease symptoms and progression as adults. That said, a2019 reviewsuggests that you may also notice some psychological symptoms in your child, such as: anger or aggression mood changes depression nightmares If your child seems to be acting differently and can’t explain why or what they’re feeling, speak with a doctor. These changes could be a sign of many conditions, including Lyme disease."
860,Lyme Disease,How is Lyme disease diagnosed?,"Lyme disease may be difficult to diagnose because many of the symptoms are similar to those of other conditions. A healthcare professional will first perform a medical history andphysical examinationto look for erythema migrans and other symptoms characteristic of Lyme disease. If you don’t have visual symptoms of Lyme disease, they’ll recommend atwo-stepserology. This may include the followingtwo blood teststo help detect antibodies: enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Western blot It’s important to note that blood tests are most reliable only a few weeks after the initial infection. This is when antibodies are present. Someat-home Lyme disease testing kitsare also available. These may be beneficial if you’ve recently been bitten by a tick or you recently spent time in an area where ticks are common. However, it’s best to see a doctor if you experience any signs or symptoms of Lyme disease. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out ourFindCare tool. Some commercial laboratories test ticks for Lyme disease. However, theCDC doesn’t recommend tick testingfor the following reasons: Commercial laboratories that offer tick testing aren’t required to have the same stringent quality control standards as those for clinical diagnostic laboratories. If the tick tests positive for a disease-causing organism, it doesn’t necessarily mean you have Lyme disease. A negative result could lead you to the false assumption that you don’t have an infection. You could have been bitten by a different tick that transmitted Lyme disease. If you have Lyme disease, you’ll probably start showing the symptoms before you get the tick test results, and you shouldn’t wait to start treatment."
861,Lyme Disease,How is Lyme disease treated?,"Treatment for Lyme disease will depend on the progression of the infection. Lyme disease is best treated in the early stages. Treatment for early localized disease is a10- to 14-daycourse of oral antibiotics to eliminate the infection. Medications used to treat Lyme disease include: doxycycline amoxicillin cefuroxime If Lyme disease has progressed beyond stage 1 or affects yourcirculatoryorcentral nervoussystems, a doctor may prescribe intravenous (IV) antibiotics. This will then be followed up with an oral regimen. The complete course of treatment usually takes 14–28 days. If you experience abnormal heart rhythm or heart block, a doctor may alsorecommendyou stay in the hospital to be monitored until the abnormality resolves. Lyme arthritis, a late-stage symptom of Lyme disease, is also treated with oral antibiotics for28 days."
862,Lyme Disease,Lyme disease transmission,"Ticks infected with the bacterium B. burgdorferi can attach to any part of your body. They’re more commonly found in moist areas of your body that are hard to see, such as the scalp, armpits, and groin area. The infected tick must be attached to your body for at least36 hoursto transmit the bacterium. Most Lyme disease infectious are caused by immature ticks, called nymphs. They feed during the spring and summer. Nymphs are more likely to transmit Lyme diseasedue to their size. They’re roughly the size of a poppy seed, which makes them harder to see and remove than adult ticks. There’s currentlyno evidencethat Lyme disease is contagious between people, according to theCDC. This means it cannot be transmitted through touching, kissing, having sex, or air, food, and water."
863,Lyme Disease,Risk factors for Lyme disease,"Living in a state with a high prevalence of Lyme disease may increase your risk of being bitten by an infected tick. According to theCDC, as of 2021, the U.S. states with the highest incidence of Lyme disease include: Connecticut Delaware Maine Maryland Massachusetts Minnesota New Hampshire New Jersey New York Pennsylvania Rhode Island Vermont Virginia West Virginia Wisconsin People who work outdoorsare also at an elevated riskof Lyme disease, including those who work in: construction landscaping forestry farming park or wildlife management Most tick bites happen in the summer when ticks are most active and people spend more time outside. However, it’s possible to get Lyme disease from tick bites in early fall, and even in late winter if the weather is unseasonably warm."
864,Lyme Disease,Prevention of Lyme disease and ticks,"Here are some frequently asked questions about the prevention of Lyme disease and ticks. Yes, you can prevent Lyme disease by protecting yourself from ticks. This is because the infection is transmitted through bites from infected ticks. Some ways to prevent tick bites mayinclude: wearing long pants and long-sleeve shirts when outdoors protecting your clothing with permethrin using insect repellents, such as DEET products usingnatural insect repellants, such asoil of lemon eucalyptus checking yourself and your pets after being outside in areas with brush, long grass, and wood Checking yourself for ticks in the shower or bath is important after you’ve come in from outside. Other than that, check your clothes, especially the folds of your clothes, knowing that ticks can be very small and hard to spot. Running your hands through your hair is also a good idea. If a tick bites you, it’s important to remove it as soon as possible. According to theCDC, the best way toremove a tickis to: Use a pair of tweezers to grab the tick. Steadily pull upward, being careful not to twist the tweezers (this may cause the mouth parts of the tick to break off and stay stuck in the skin). After removing the tick, clean the bite area with soap and water, or rubbing alcohol. Don’t crush the tick. Dispose of it by putting it in alcohol, flushing it down the toilet, or putting it in a sealed bag and in the trash."
865,Lyme Disease,What is the outlook for someone with Lyme disease?,"The majority of people who receive a diagnosis of Lyme disease will recover within2–4 weeksof starting treatment, according to the CDC. However, approximately5–10%of people with Lyme disease will experiencepost-Lyme disease syndrome, also known as chronic Lyme disease. Symptoms of post-Lyme disease syndrome are similar to those that occur in the earlier stages of the condition, such as: fatigue difficulty sleeping aching joints or muscles pain or swelling in your large joints, such as yourknees,shoulders, orelbows difficulty concentrating andshort-term memoryproblems speech problems Treatment is primarily focused on easing pain and discomfort. Most people recover, but it can take months or years."
866,Lyme Disease,Frequently asked questions,"In most cases, Lyme disease can go away with early diagnosis and treatment. However, if you start treatment in the later stages, you may experience long-term complications like damage to your joints. Most people can live a normal life after receiving treatment for Lyme disease. However, up to10%of people experience chronic symptoms of Lyme disease that could affect mobility and cognitive skills. If left untreated, Lyme disease may progress and cause serious neurological andrheumatoidcomplications. These may include facial palsy, extreme fatigue, meningitis, and arthritis, among others. It’s important to get treated as early as possible if you have Lyme disease. Antibiotics are needed to treat Lyme disease. Left untreated, the infection can progressively get worse and lead to more serious long-term complications."
867,Lyme Disease,Takeaway,"Lyme disease is an infection caused by a tick bite from an infected tick. If you find a tick on your body, it’s important to properly remove it as soon as possible. Then, monitor the tick bite area. If a bull’s eye rash appears, speak with a healthcare professional as soon as you can. Early diagnosis and treatment can help treat Lyme disease."
868,Malaria,Overview,"What is malaria? Malaria is a life-threatening disease. It’s typically transmitted through the bite of an infectedAnophelesmosquito. Infected mosquitoes carry thePlasmodiumparasite. When this mosquito bites you, the parasite is released into your bloodstream. Once the parasites are inside your body, they travel to theliver, where they mature. After several days, the mature parasites enter the bloodstream and begin to infectred blood cells. Within 48 to 72 hours, the parasites inside the red blood cells multiply, causing the infected cells to burst open. The parasites continue to infect red blood cells, resulting in symptoms that occur in cycles that last two to three days at a time. Malaria is typically found in tropical and subtropical climates where the parasites can live. TheWorld Health Organization (WHO)states that, in 2016, there were an estimated 216 million cases of malaria in 91 countries. In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) report1,700 casesof malaria annually. Most cases of malaria develop in people whotravel to countrieswhere malaria is more common. Read more: Learn about the relationship between cytopenia and malaria »"
869,Malaria,What causes malaria?,"Malaria can occur if a mosquito infected with thePlasmodiumparasite bites you. There are four kinds of malaria parasites that can infect humans:Plasmodium vivax,P. ovale,P. malariae, andP. falciparum. P. falciparumcauses a more severe form of the disease and those who contract this form of malaria have a higher risk of death. An infected mother can also pass the disease to her baby at birth. This is known as congenital malaria. Malaria is transmitted by blood, so it can also be transmitted through: an organ transplant atransfusion use of shared needles or syringes"
870,Malaria,What are the symptoms of malaria?,"The symptoms of malaria typically develop within 10 days to 4 weeks following the infection. In some cases, symptoms may not develop for several months. Some malarial parasites can enter the body but will be dormant for long periods of time. Common symptoms of malaria include: shakingchillsthat can range from moderate to severe highfever profusesweating headache nausea vomiting abdominal pain diarrhea anemia muscle pain convulsions coma bloody stools"
871,Malaria,How is malaria diagnosed?,"Your doctor will be able to diagnose malaria. During your appointment, your doctor will review your health history, including any recent travel to tropical climates. A physical exam will also be performed. Your doctor will be able to determine if you have anenlarged spleenorliver. If you have symptoms of malaria, your doctor may order additional blood tests to confirm your diagnosis. These tests will show: whether you have malaria what type of malaria you have if your infection is caused by aparasitethat’s resistant to certain types of drugs if the disease has caused anemia if the disease has affected your vital organs"
872,Malaria,Life-threatening complications of malaria,"Malaria can cause a number of life-threatening complications. The following may occur: swelling of the blood vessels of the brain, or cerebral malaria an accumulation of fluid in the lungs that causes breathing problems, orpulmonary edema organ failure of thekidneys,liver, or spleen anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells low blood sugar"
873,Malaria,How is malaria treated?,"Malaria can be a life-threatening condition, especially if you’re infected with the parasiteP. falciparum. Treatment for the disease is typically provided in a hospital. Your doctor will prescribe medications based on the type of parasite that you have. In some instances, the medication prescribed may not clear the infection because of parasite resistance to drugs. If this occurs, your doctor may need to use more than one medication or change medications altogether to treat your condition. Additionally, certain types of malaria parasites, such asP. vivaxandP. ovale, have liver stages where the parasite can live in your body for an extended period of time and reactivate at a later date causing a relapse of the infection. If you’re found to have one of these types of malaria parasites, you’ll be given a second medication to prevent a relapse in the future."
874,Malaria,What’s the long-term outlook for people with malaria?,"People with malaria who receive treatment typically have a good long-term outlook. If complications arise as a result of malaria, the outlook may not be as good. Cerebral malaria, which causes swelling of the blood vessels of the brain, can result inbrain damage. The long-term outlook for patients with drug-resistant parasites may also be poor. In these patients, malaria may recur. This may cause other complications."
875,Malaria,Tips to prevent malaria,"There’s no vaccine available to prevent malaria. Talk to your doctor if you’re traveling to an area where malaria is common or if you live in such an area. You may be prescribed medications to prevent the disease. These medications are the same as those used to treat the disease and should be taken before, during, and after your trip. Talk to your doctor about long-term prevention if you live in an area where malaria is common. Sleeping under amosquito netmay help prevent being bitten by an infected mosquito. Covering your skin or usingbug sprays containing DEET] may also help prevent infection. If you’re unsure if malaria is prevalent in your area, the CDC has an up-to-datemapof where malaria can be found."
876,Menopause,Overview,"Perimenopause is a gradual process that may last several years, often beginning in your mid-40s. Common symptoms during this period include hot flashes, difficulty sleeping, and vaginal dryness. The onset of menopause occurs after 12 consecutive months without menstruation. It marks the transition to postmenopause. Your hormone levels naturally decline as you reach the end of your reproductive years. Once you reach menopause, you will no longer ovulate or experience a menstrual period. This means you will no longer be able to become pregnant. People in the United States generally experience natural menopause at around 51 years old."
877,Menopause,What are the stages of menopause?,"Menopause is a gradual process. It usually takesabout 7 yearsfrom beginning to end but may last up to 14 years. The time leading up to menopause isperimenopause. It usually begins in your mid-40s. Your hormone levels begin to change, causing menstruation to becomemore irregular. Perimenopause can last anywhere from a few months to several years. Menopause occurs when 12 or more months have passed since your last menstrual period. Although many people experience menopause in their early 50s, this transition can happen earlier in life. Early menopauseoccurs at ages 40–45 years. Premature menopause occurs before age 40."
878,Menopause,What are the symptoms of menopause?,"Everyone’s experience of menopause is unique. Some people experience severe andwide-ranging symptoms, while others may barely notice the change. Common physical symptoms include: changes in breast size or shape dry eyes flushing hair loss headaches hot flashes increased facial or body hair (hirsutism) increased heart rate (palpitations) increased urination insomnia itching muscle orjoint pain night sweats pain during penetrative sex (dyspareunia) sore or tender breasts vulvovaginal atrophy, which can causevaginal dryness weight gain Common mental and emotional symptoms include: anxiety decreased sexual desire (libido) depression difficulty concentrating (brain fog) irritability fatigue forgetfulness unpredictable shifts in mood Physical changes during menopause can increase your risk of: heart disease osteoporosis urinary incontinence urinary tract infections (UTIs) vaginal infections"
879,Menopause,Why does menopause occur?,"Menopause is a natural process that results fromchanging levelsof estrogen, progesterone, and other hormones as you age. These changes are linked to a loss of active ovarian follicles. These structures produce and release eggs from the ovary wall. In some cases, menopause may start early as a result of: chemotherapy gender affirming hormone therapy pelvic injury radiation therapy surgery"
880,Menopause,How do you know whether you’re experiencing menopause?,"If you’re experiencing unusual symptoms and aren’t sure if they’re related to menopause, make an appointment with a healthcare professional. They can order blood tests to confirm whether menopause is likely. The PicoAMH Elisa diagnostic test canhelp determinewhether menopause has begun. Other blood tests can measure levels ofFSHandestradiol, a form of estrogen. Blood levels that are consistently 30 mIU/mL or higher, combined with a lack of menstruation for 1 year, can usually confirm menopause. Depending on your symptoms and overall history, your healthcare professional may order blood tests to rule out other underlying conditions. This includes tests for: cholesterol estradiol human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) kidney function liver function progesterone prolactin testosterone thyroid function"
881,Menopause,What can you do to treat menopause symptoms?,"If your symptoms are causing you distress or interfering with your quality of life, consider making an appointment with a healthcare professional.

However, there islittle evidenceto support these claims, and more research is needed. Somealternative remediesare believed to increase estrogen levels, but there’s not enough evidence to prove they are safe or effective. This includessoy isoflavones,melatonin, andflaxseed."
883,Menopause,Frequently asked questions,"There are three stages of menopause: perimenopause, menopause, and postmenopause. Perimenopause occurs before menopause. During this stage, menstruation becomes irregular and menstrual flow may be heavier or lighter. You may experience symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats. Menopause is when menstruation has not occurred for one full year. Hot flashes and other symptoms may continue. Postmenopauserefers to the years after menopause. During these years, menopause symptoms usually taper off, but other health conditions may begin, such as osteoporosis. Early signs of menopause typically include irregular menstruation, but you may also start to notice hot flashes, mood changes, and other unusual symptoms. As youend your reproductive years, your body starts to produce less estrogen, and eventually menstruation stops. This drop in estrogen can lead to a range of symptoms, such as hot flashes."
884,Menopause,The bottom line,"Menopause marks the natural end of fertility and occurs 12 months after your last menstrual period. Symptoms of menopause may start several years earlier and include menstrual changes, hot flashes, night sweats, and flushing. Symptoms can continue for several years after menopause. It’s worth seeking medical help if menopause symptoms are affecting your daily life, you have other symptoms not related to menopause, or you’re experiencing menopause symptoms and are younger than age 45 years."
885,Menstrual Pain,Overview,"Painful menstruation is called dysmenorrhea. There are two types: primary and secondary. Certain medical conditions, including endometriosis and pelvic inflammatory disease, can cause it. Menstruationoccurs when the uterus sheds its lining once a month. Some pain, cramping, and discomfort during menstrual periods is normal.Excessive painthat causes you to miss work or school is not. Primary dysmenorrhea occurs in people who experience pain before and during menstruation. If you’ve had normal periods that become painful later in life, it may be secondary dysmenorrhea. A condition affecting the uterus or other pelvic organs, such asendometriosisoruterine fibroids, can cause this."
886,Menstrual Pain,What are the causes?,"It’s not always possible to identify the cause of painful menstrual periods. Some people are just at a higher risk of having painful periods. These risks include: being under age 20 having a family history of painful periods smoking havingheavy bleedingwith periods havingirregular periods never having had a baby reaching puberty before age 11 A hormone called prostaglandin triggers muscle contractions in your uterus that expel the lining. These contractions can cause pain and inflammation. The level of prostaglandin rises right before menstruation begins. Painful menstrual periods can also be the result of an underlying medical condition, such as: Premenstrual syndrome (PMS).PMS is a common condition that’s caused by hormonal changes in the body occurring 1 to 2 weeks before menstruation begins. Symptoms typically go away after bleeding begins. Endometriosis.This is a painful medical condition in which cells from the lining of the uterus grow in other parts of the body, usually on the fallopian tubes, ovaries, or tissue lining the pelvis. Fibroids in the uterus.Fibroids are noncancerous tumors that can put pressure on the uterus or cause abnormal menstruation and pain, though they often don’t cause symptoms. Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).PID is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes, or ovaries often caused by sexually transmitted bacteria that cause inflammation of the reproductive organs and pain. Adenomyosis.This is a rare condition in which the uterine lining grows into the muscular wall of the uterus, causing inflammation, pressure, and pain. It can also cause longer or heavier periods. Cervical stenosis.Cervical stenosis is a rare condition in which the cervix is so small or narrow that it slows menstrual flow, causing an increase of pressure inside the uterus that causes pain."
887,Menstrual Pain,Home treatment,"At-home treatments can be helpful in relieving painful menstrual periods. Types of things to try at home include: using aheating padon your pelvic area or back massaging your abdomen taking awarm bath doing regular physical exercise eating light, nutritious meals practicingrelaxation techniquesor yoga taking anti-inflammatory medications such as ibuprofen several days before you expect your period takingvitamins and supplementssuch as:vitamin B-6vitamin B-1vitamin Eomega-3 fatty acidscalciummagnesiumraising your legs or lying with your knees bentreducing your intake of salt, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar toprevent bloating vitamin B-6 vitamin B-1 vitamin E omega-3 fatty acids calcium magnesium raising your legs or lying with your knees bent reducing your intake of salt, alcohol, caffeine, and sugar toprevent bloating"
888,Menstrual Pain,When to call a doctor,"If menstrual pain is interfering with your ability to perform basic tasks each month, it may be time to talk to a gynecologist. Talk to your doctor about your symptoms and if you experience any of the following: continuingpain after IUD placement at least three painful menstrual periods passingblood clots cramping accompanied by diarrhea and nausea pelvic painwhen not menstruating Sudden cramping or pelvic pain could be signs of infection. An untreated infection can cause scar tissue that damages the pelvic organs and may lead to infertility. If you have symptoms of an infection, seek prompt medical attention: fever severe pelvic pain sudden pain, especially if you may be pregnant foul-smelling vaginal discharge"
889,Menstrual Pain,Diagnosis,"When trying to find out what the underlying cause of painful menstruation is, your doctor will likely take your medical history and perform a physical exam. This will include apelvic examto check for any abnormalities in your reproductive system and to look for signs of infection. If your doctor thinks an underlying disorder is causing your symptoms, they may perform imaging tests. These can include: anultrasound aCT scan anMRI Depending on the results of your imaging tests, your doctor may order alaparoscopy. This is a test in which a doctor makes small incisions in the abdomen into which they insert a fiber-optic tube with a camera at the end to see inside your abdominal cavity."
890,Menstrual Pain,Medical treatment,"If at-home treatment doesn’t relieve your menstrual pain, medical treatment options exist. Treatment will depend on the severity and underlying cause of your pain. If PID or sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are causing your pain, your doctor will prescribe antibiotics to clear the infection. Your doctor may also prescribe medications that include: Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs).You can find these drugsover the counteror get prescription-strength NSAIDs from your doctor. Other pain relievers.This includes over-the-counter options likeacetaminophen(Tylenol) or strongerprescription pain medications. Antidepressants.Antidepressantsare sometimes prescribed to help lessen some of the mood swings associated with PMS. Your doctor may also suggest that you tryhormonal birth control. Hormonal birth control is available as a pill, patch, vaginal ring, injection, implant, or IUD. Hormones prevent ovulation, which can control your menstrual cramps. Surgery can treat endometriosis or uterine fibroids. This is an option if other treatments haven’t been successful. The surgery removes any endometriosis implants, uterine fibroids, or cysts. In rare cases, ahysterectomy(the surgical removal of the uterus) is an option if other treatments haven’t worked and pain is severe. If you have a hysterectomy you will no longer be able to have children. This option is usually only used if someone isn’t planning on having children or is at the end of their childbearing years."
891,Menstrual Pain,4 Yoga Poses to Relieve Cramps,
892,Menstrual Problems,Overview,"What Are Menstrual Problems? Menstrual cycles often bring about a variety of uncomfortable symptoms leading up to your period. Premenstrual syndrome (PMS) encompasses the most common issues, such as mild cramping and fatigue, but the symptoms usually go away when your period begins. However, other, more serious menstrual problems may also occur. Menstruation that is too heavy or too light, or the complete absence of a cycle, may suggest that there are other issues that are contributing to an abnormal menstrual cycle. Remember that a “normal” menstrual cycle means something different for every woman. A cycle that’s regular for you may be abnormal for someone else. It’s important to stay in tune with your body and to talk to your doctor if you notice any significant changes to your menstrual cycle. There are several different menstrual problems that you may experience."
893,Menstrual Problems,Premenstrual Syndrome,"PMS occurs one to two weeks before your period begins. Some women experience a range of physical and emotional symptoms. Others experience few symptoms or even none at all. PMS can cause: bloating irritability backaches headaches breast soreness acne food cravings excessive fatigue depression anxiety feelings of stress insomnia constipation diarrhea mild stomach cramps You may experience different symptoms every month, and the severity of these symptoms can also vary. PMS is uncomfortable, but it’s generally not worrisome unless it interferes with your normal activities."
894,Menstrual Problems,Heavy Periods,"Another common menstrual problem is a heavy period. Also called menorrhagia, heavy periods cause you to bleed more than normal. You may also have your period for longer than the average of five to seven days. Menorrhagia is mostly caused by imbalances in hormone levels, especially progesterone and estrogen. Other causes of heavy or irregular menstrual bleeding include: puberty vaginal infections inflammation of the cervix underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) noncancerous uterus tumors (fibroids) changes in diet or exercise"
895,Menstrual Problems,Absent Periods,"In some cases, women may not get their period. This is called amenorrhea. Primary amenorrhea is when you don’t get your first period by age 16. This may be caused by an issue with the pituitary gland, a congenital defect of the female reproductive system, or a delay in puberty. Secondary amenorrhea occurs when you stop getting your regular periods for six months or more. Common causes of primary amenorrhea and secondary amenorrhea in teens include: anorexia overactive thyroid gland (hyperthyroidism) ovarian cysts sudden weight gain or loss stopping birth control pregnancy When adults do not menstruate, the common causes are often different. These may include: premature ovarian failure pelvic inflammatory disease (a reproductive infection) stopping birth control pregnancy breastfeeding menopause A missed period could mean that you’re pregnant. If you suspect you may be pregnant, be sure to take a pregnancy test. Drugstore pregnancy tests are the least expensive way to determine whether or not you are pregnant. To get the most accurate results, wait until you have missed your period by at least one day before taking the test."
896,Menstrual Problems,Painful Periods,"Not only can your period be lighter or heavier than normal, but it can also be painful. Cramps are normal during PMS and they also occur when your uterus contracts as your period begins. However, some women experience excruciating pain. Also called dysmenorrhea, extremely painful menstruation is likely linked to an underlying medical problem, such as: fibroids pelvic inflammatory disease abnormal tissue growth outside of the uterus (endometriosis)"
897,Menstrual Problems,Diagnosing Menstrual Problems,"The first step in diagnosing menstrual problems is to see your doctor. Your doctor will want to know about your symptoms and for how long you’ve been experiencing them. It may help to come prepared with notes on your menstrual cycle, how regular it is, and any symptoms you have been experiencing. Your doctor can use these notes to help figure out what is abnormal. In addition to a physical exam, your doctor will likely do a pelvic exam. A pelvic exam allows your doctor to assess your reproductive organs and to determine if your vagina or cervix is inflamed. A Pap smear will also be performed to rule out the possibility of cancer or other underlying conditions. Blood tests can help determine whether hormonal imbalances are causing your menstrual problems. If you suspect that you may be pregnant, your doctor or nurse practitioner will order a blood or urine pregnancy test during your visit. Other tests your doctor may use to help diagnose the source of your menstrual problems include: endometrial biopsy (used to extract a sample of your uterine lining that can be sent for further analysis) hysteroscopy (a small camera is inserted into your uterus to help your doctor find any abnormalities) ultrasound (used to produce a picture of your uterus)"
898,Menstrual Problems,Treating Menstrual Problems,"The type of treatment will depend on what’s causing the problems with your menstrual cycle.Birth control pillscan relieve symptoms of PMS, as well as regulate heavy flows. If a heavier or lighter than normal flow is related to a thyroid or other hormonal disorder, you may experience more regularity once you start hormone replacements. Dysmenorrhea may be hormone related, but you may also require further medical treatment to address the problem. For example, antibiotics are used to treat pelvic inflammatory disease."
899,Menstrual Problems,Long-Term Outlook,"Irregularities between periods are normal, so the occasional light or heavy flow is generally not something to worry about. However, if you experience severe pain or a heavy flow with blood clots, you should call your doctor right away. It’s is also recommended that you get medical attention if your periods occur less than 21 days apart, or if they happen more than 35 days apart."
900,Migraine,Overview,"Migraine is a neurological condition that typically causes painful headaches that occur with additional symptoms, such as sensitivity to light, sound, smell, or touch. Most migraine episodes last 4 to 72 hours without treatment. Some rare complications of migraine can cause symptoms that last longer. The diagnosis of migraine is determined based on clinical history, reported symptoms, and by ruling out other causes. More than just the cause of “really bad headaches,” migraine is a neurological condition that can cause multiple symptoms. While intense, debilitating headaches frequently characterize it, additional symptoms may include: nausea vomiting difficulty speaking numbness or tingling sensitivity to light and sound The condition often runs in families and can affect all ages. People assigned female at birth are more likely than people assigned male at birth to be diagnosed with migraine. The diagnosis of migraine is determined based on clinical history, reported symptoms, and by ruling out other causes. The most common categories of migraine headaches (or attacks) are episodic versus chronic, and then those without aura and those with aura."
901,Migraine,What does migraine feel like?,"People describe migraine pain as: pulsating throbbing perforating pounding debilitating It can also feel like a severe, dull, steady ache. The pain may start out as mild. But without treatment, it can become moderate to severe. Migraine pain most commonly affects the forehead area. It’susually on one side of the headbut can occur on both sides or shift. Children aremore likelyto experience migraine on both sides of the head. Read more:“How to Tell the Difference Between Migraine and Other Types of Headaches” Most migraine attacks last4 to 72 hourswithout treatment. Some rarecomplicationsof migraine, likestatus migrainosus, can cause symptoms that last longer. In migraine with aura, pain may overlap with an aura or may never occur at all."
902,Migraine,What are the symptoms of migraine?,"Migraine symptoms may vary depending on the type of migraine you experience. They also vary depending on whichphase of a migraine attackyou’re in: Prodrome:Symptoms may begin1 to 2 daysbefore the headache itself. You may experience food cravings, changes in mood or energy, and neck stiffness, among other symptoms. Aura:Aboutone-quarterof people with migraine experienceauraas part of an attack. These are sensory symptoms (most often visual) that can last5 to 60 minutes. Headache:Most people experience head pain that can be severe and can last for hours to days. During this phase, people also experience increased sensitivity to light and sounds, nausea, and dizziness. Postdrome:During this phase, you may experience changes in mood, difficulty concentrating, and exhaustion. A mild, dull headache may persist. The duration and intensity of these phases can vary in different people. Not everyone experiences all the phases. In some cases, an attack can occur without a headache. Read more:“Signs and Symptoms of a Migraine and How to Manage” Many people experiencenauseaas a symptom of migraine. Many also vomit. These symptoms may start at the same time as the attack. However, they usually start about an hour after the headache pain begins. If you only have nausea, you may be able to take your usual migraine medications. Vomiting, though, can prevent you from being able to take pills or keep them in your body long enough to be absorbed. A doctor may suggest taking anti-nausea orantiemetic medicationsto help prevent vomiting and improve nausea."
903,Migraine,What causes migraine?,"Researchers haven’t identified a definitive cause for migraine. But experts believe a combination of genetics, hormones, and irregular brain activity all play a role. These factors likely contribute to affecting nerve signaling, chemicals, and blood vessels in the brain. Migraine affects about14% to 15%of the global population and can affect anyone. However, because of the role of genetics and hormones, some people are more at risk. For example, migraine tends to run in families. Women are alsothree to four timesmore likely than men to experience migraine. While data is limited, research suggests that transgender women who take gender affirming hormone therapy have rates of migrainesimilarto cisgender women. Migraine most commonly affects people between the ages of20 and 50, though up to10%of children experience migraine headaches as well."
904,Migraine,What can trigger a migraine attack?,"More than three-quartersof people with migraine report that something triggers their migraine attacks. These could be things in their diet, changes in their environment, or other events. While migraine triggers can be very personal, commonly reported triggersinclude: bright lights severe heat, or otherextremes in weather dehydration changes inbarometric pressure hormone changesin people assigned female at birth, like estrogen and progesterone fluctuations duringmenstruation,pregnancy, ormenopause excessstress loud sounds intense physical activity skipping meals changes in sleep patterns use of certain medications, likeoral contraceptivesor nitroglycerin unusual smells certain foods smoking alcohol use traveling If you experience a migraine attack, a doctor may ask you to keep a headache journal. Writing down what you were doing, what foods you ate, and what medications you took before your migraine attack began can help identify your triggers. Read more:“Top Migraine Triggers”"
905,Migraine,What is the treatment for migraine?,"There’s no cure for migraine, but a doctor can help provide you with the tools you need to manage the condition. These may include lifestyle adjustments and medications to reduce the frequency of attacks and treat symptoms when they occur. Your treatment plan depends on: your age how often you have migraine attacks the type of migraine you have how severe they are — based on how long they last, how much pain you have, and how often they keep you from going to school or work whether they include nausea or vomiting, as well as other symptoms other health conditions you may have and other medications you may take Your treatment plan may consist of a combination of: lifestyle adjustments, includingstress managementandavoiding migraine triggers over-the-counter and prescription medications neuromodulation devices hormone therapy if migraine attacks seem to occurin relation to your menstrual cycle alternative care, which may includemeditation, acupressure, oracupuncture counseling If you have several migraine attacks a month,preventive medicationscan help reduce the frequency. These may be pills you take daily orinjectionsyou receive every few months. Options include: beta-blockers, like propranolol anticonvulsants, like valproate (Depakote) and topimarate (Topamax) antidepressants, likeamitriptylineandvenlafaxine Botoxinjections calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antagonists, like erenumab (Aimovig) and fremanezumab (Ajovy) Once symptoms begin, you may be able to get relief fromabortive medications, including: over-the-counter pain relieverslikenonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)or acetaminophen (Tylenol) triptans, likesumatriptan(Imirex), eletriptan (Relpax), and rizatriptan (Maxalt) gepants, like ubrogepant (Ubrelvy) and rimegepant (Nurtec ODT), are an oral form of anti-CGRP medication ergot alkaloids, likedihydroergotamine (DHE), though these are older medications antiemetics, likemetoclopramide, chlorpromazine, and prochlorperazine, to help decrease nausea If traditional treatments don’t work, a doctor may recommendneuromodulation devicesto treat migraine by either increasing or decreasing nervous system activity. Depending on the type, these may work as either preventive or abortive medications. Current options approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) include: single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulator, a handheld device that produces a magnetic impulse that affects electrical signaling in the brain transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulator, a small, noninvasive tool that targets the vagus nerve in the neck via electrical stimulation transcutaneous supraorbital neurostimulator, a device that simulates the supraorbital nerves with electrical stimulation multi-channel brain neuromodulation system, a headset that can target multiple nerves in the head Talk with your doctor about the best neuromodulation treatment for you and your specific type of migraine.

907,Migraine,What are the types of migraine?,"TheInternational Headache Society (IHS)classifies migraine into several different types: Migraine without aura:This is the most common type. It’s also known as “common migraine.” Migraine with aura:Also known as “classical migraine,” about one-quarter of people havemigraine with aura. Each aura symptom may last up to 60 minutes. Visual auras are most common, but people may also experience sensory, speech, or motor symptoms. Migraine with brainstem aura (MBA):Commonly known as “basilar migraine,” the aura phase features symptoms like vertigo, slurred speech, and tinnitus. However, motor symptoms are absent. Hemiplegic migraine:Unlike MBA, this rare migraine type features motor weakness along with other brainstem symptoms. The motor symptoms may last up to 72 hours. This type can oftenrun in families. Retinal migraine:In retinal migraine, you experience visual disturbances in one eye for5 to 60 minutesprior to the onset of a headache. Some people use the term “ocular migraine” to refer to any migraine that causes visual symptoms, which can include retinal migraine or migraine with aura. Silent migraine:The IHS officially calls this “typical aura without headache,” which accurately describes the symptoms. According to the American Migraine Foundation,silent migrainemay be more common in people who start getting migraineafter age 40. Vestibular migraine:This term doesn’t necessarily refer to a type of migraine but more tovertigo that occurs with migraine. Vertigo is a sensation that the world is spinning around you. Abdominal migraine:Unlike typical migraine, abdominal migraine affects your abdomen rather than your head. Itmostlyaffects children. Some people living with migraine have more than one type of migraine. Read more:“Your Guide to the Different Types of Migraine” Doctors often classify migraine as chronic or episodic migraine. According toIHS criteria, doctors diagnosechronic migrainewhen you experience headaches at least 15 days each month for more than 3 months. On at least 8 of those days, the headache had to have features of a migraine. Episodic migraine is the diagnosis when you have fewer than 15 headache days in a month."
908,Migraine,How is migraine diagnosed?,"Doctors diagnose migraine by listening to your symptoms, taking a thorough medical and family history, and performing a physical exam to rule out other potential causes. Imaging scans, like aCT scanorMRI, can rule out other causes, including: tumors abnormal brain structures stroke Read more:“What Happens During a Migraine Diagnosis?”"

It’s rare for children to have headache pain in the back of the head. Their migraine attacks tend to last2 to 72 hours. Some migraine variants, likeabdominal migraine, are more common in children. Children who have abdominal migraine arelikelyto develop more typical migraine symptoms as adults. Read more:“Overview of Migraine in Children”"
911,Migraine,Migraine and pregnancy,"For some pregnant people, migraine attacks improve during pregnancy butworsen following deliverydue to sudden hormonal shifts. Migraine attacks during pregnancy need special attention to make sure that the cause of the attack is understood. A 2022 study linked migraine attacks with a26%higher chance of adverse pregnancy outcomes, such aspreeclampsiaandpreterm or early delivery. Certain migraine medications, including aspirin,may not be safeduring pregnancy. If you have migraine during pregnancy, work with your doctor to find ways to treat your migraine that won’t harm your developing baby."
912,Migraine,Medication overuse headache,"The frequent and recurring use of migraine medication can sometimes causemedication overuse headaches(previously called rebound headaches). When determining how to manage migraine, talk with a doctor about the frequency of your medication intake. Also, make sure to discuss alternatives to medications."
913,Migraine,Migraine vs. tension headache,"Migraine and tension headaches, the most common type of headaches, share some similar symptoms. But migraine may feature many symptoms not seen with tension headaches. Migraine and tension headaches may also respond differently to the same treatments. Both tension headaches and migraine can have: mild to moderate pain a steady ache pain on both sides of the head Only migraine can have these symptoms: severe, debilitating pain pounding or throbbing an inability to do your usual activities pain on one side of the head nausea with or without vomiting an aura sensitivity to light, sound, or both"

916,Mouth Ulcers,Overview,"Mouth ulcers, which include canker sores, are small sores that develop within the mouth. There are no definite causes of mouth ulcers, but some injuries, allergies, or sensitivities may trigger them."
917,Mouth Ulcers,"Mouth ulcers: Symptoms, causes, and treatments","Mouth ulcers are painful and typically small lesions that develop in your mouth or at the base of your gums. They can make eating, drinking, and talking uncomfortable. Types of mouth ulcers include canker sores and the sores caused by hand, foot, and mouth disease. Mouth ulcers are rarely contagious and usually go awayafter 1 to 2 weeks, even without treatment. If you get a mouth ulcer that is large, is extremely painful, or lasts for a long time without healing, seek the advice of a doctor or dentist."
918,Mouth Ulcers,Causes of mouth ulcers,"There’s no definite cause behind mouth ulcers, but certain risk factors and triggers have been identified. People assigned female at birth, children, adolescents, and those with a family history of mouth ulcers have a higher risk of developing them. Triggers include: minor mouth injury from dental work, hard brushing, sports injury, or anaccidental bite dental braces toothpaste or mouthwash that containssodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) an allergic response tooral bacteria bacterial, viral, or fungal infections in the mouth, such ashand, foot, and mouth disease sensitivitiestoacidic foods and beverageslike strawberries, citrus fruits, pineapple, chocolate, and coffee certain nutrient deficiencies, especiallyvitamin B9 (folate),vitamin B12,zinc, andiron hormonal changes, such as those that occur duringmenstruationor pregnancy emotional stress lack of sleep Mouth ulcers can also be a sign of conditions that are more serious and require medical treatment, such as: celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), includingulcerative colitis diabetes HIV some autoimmune diseases, including:lupusoral lichen planusBehçet’s disease, a rare condition that causes inflammation throughout the blood vessels lupus oral lichen planus Behçet’s disease, a rare condition that causes inflammation throughout the blood vessels"
919,Mouth Ulcers,Mouth ulcer symptoms,"Symptoms of mouth ulcers may vary depending on their cause, but they typically include: painful sores that may be yellow, white, or red sores on the inside of the mouth, such as on your tongue or the insides of your cheeks or lips areas of redness or other color changes surrounding the sores pain that worsens when you eat, drink, or talk You may have more than one mouth ulcer at the same time. Mouth ulcers are not usually contagious unless they’re caused by an infection such as hand, foot, and mouth disease. Canker soresare the most common type of mouth ulcer, with20% of peoplehaving a canker sore at least once. There are three main types of canker sores: minor major herpetiform Minor canker sores are small oval or round ulcers measuring under5 millimeters (mm). They heal within 1 to 2 weeks and don’t cause scars. According to DermNet New Zealand,80% of peoplewith canker sores have minor canker sores, making them the most common type. Major canker sores are larger and deeper than minor ones. They often measureover 10 mm. They have irregular edges and can take weeks or months to heal. Major canker sores can result in long-term scarring. Herpetiform canker sores are pinpoint-sized, occur in clusters, and often appear on the tongue. Sometimes the clusters can merge to form one large sore. Herpetiform canker sores have irregular edges and often heal without scarringwithin 1 month. They’re called “herpetiform” because they may resemble the sores caused byherpes. Herpetiform canker sores are not otherwise associated with herpes infection. See a doctor or dentist about your mouth ulcers if you develop any of the following: unusually large mouth ulcers new mouth ulcers that appear before the old ones heal sores that persist formore than 3 weeks painless sores sores that extend to the lips pain that you’re unable to manage with over-the-counter or natural medications severe problems eating and drinking high feverordiarrheawhenever your mouth ulcers appear"
920,Mouth Ulcers,Diagnosis of mouth ulcers,"Your doctor will be able to diagnose mouth ulcers through a visual exam. You might be tested for other medical conditions if you have frequent, severe mouth ulcers."
921,Mouth Ulcers,Mouth ulcer vs. cold sore,"Cold soresareanother common type of oral lesion. Although mouth ulcers and cold sores share some causes and symptoms, they are usually easy to tell apart. Mouth ulcers only appear inside the mouth. Although cold sores can appear inside the mouth, they mainly appear right above, below, or on your lips. They may also spread to the nose orchin. Cold sores are also fluid-filled, making them a type ofblister. Most mouth ulcers are not contagious. Cold sores are typically caused by the herpes virus and are always contagious. Cold sores are also more likely to cause additional symptoms beyond the lesions, including: fever fatigue malaise swollen lymph nodesin the neck Both types of lesions can cause a burning or tingling sensation on the skin that may start a few days before the lesions appear. However, this sensation is more closely associated with cold sores."
922,Mouth Ulcers,Aphthous ulcers,"Aphthous ulcer is another name for a canker sore. The medical term “aphtha” has a few definitions, but is mainly used to refer to a small ulcer."
923,Mouth Ulcers,Mouth ulcer treatment,"Most mouth ulcers don’t need treatment. However, if you get mouth ulcers often or they’re extremely painful, a number of treatments and home remedies can decrease pain and healing time. These include: covering the ulcer with a paste made frombaking soda using other topical pastes placing milk of magnesia on the ulcer using a mouth rinse made fromsalt waterand baking soda using a mouth rinse that contains a steroid to reduce pain and swelling applying ice to the ulcer placing a damp tea bag on the ulcer taking supplements if you have deficiencies in certain nutrients, including vitamin B9 (folate), vitamin B12, zinc, and iron using over-the-counter topical products that are made with benzocaine, like Orajel and Anbesol trying natural remedies, such asechinacea,myrrh, andlicorice root(may come in various forms, like teas or oils)"
924,Mouth Ulcers,How to prevent mouth ulcers,"You can take these steps to help reduce the occurrence of mouth ulcers: Avoid foods that irritate your mouth. That includes acidic fruits, nuts, chips, and anything spicy. Instead, choosewhole grainsand nonacidic fruits and vegetables. Eat awell-balanced dietand consider taking a daily multivitamin. Try to avoid talking while you’re chewing your food to reduce accidental bites. Reduce your stress. Maintain good oral hygiene byflossingdaily andbrushingafter meals. Avoid hard-bristled toothbrushes and mouthwashes containing sodium lauryl sulfate (SLS) or alcohol. Ask your dentist to give you wax to cover dental or orthodontic mouth devices that have sharp edges. Get adequate sleep and rest.This will prevent not only mouth ulcers but also a host of other illnesses."
925,Multiple Sclerosis,Overview,"Multiple sclerosis is a chronic condition affecting the central nervous system (CNS), where the immune system attacks myelin, the protective layer around nerve fibers. While there is currently no cure for MS, various treatments are available to help manage symptoms and slow disease progression, including disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) and medications to treat specific symptoms. Most people with MS have a normal life expectancy and continue to lead full lives, though symptoms can vary widely between individuals and change in severity over time. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic condition involving your central nervous system (CNS). With MS, your immune system attacks myelin, which is the protective layer around nerve fibers. MS causes inflammation and temporary lesions. It can also lead to lasting lesions caused by scar tissue, which interferes with messages in the affected areas of the brain and spinal cord. There’s no cure for MS, but it’s possible to manage symptoms. Learn more about the causes of MS, how it’s treated, and more."
926,Multiple Sclerosis,What are the symptoms of MS?,"People with MS experience a wide range of symptoms. Due to the nature of the disease, symptoms can vary widely from person to person. They can also change in severity over time and even from day to day. Some of the most common symptoms associated with MS include: Around80%of people with MS report having fatigue, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS). Fatigue due to MS can make it harder to do everyday tasks. Difficulty walking can occur with MS due to: numbness in your legs or feet difficulty balancing muscle weakness muscle spasticity difficulty with vision Difficulty walking can also lead to injuries if you fall. Vision problemsare often some of the first symptoms for many people with MS. They may affect one or both eyes. These issues may come and go, get worse over time, or resolve entirely. Common vision problems associated with MS include: optic neuritis, which can cause pain or blurry vision in one eye diplopia, or double vision nystagmus, or involuntary movement of the eyes loss of vision in one visual field or both eyes blindness MS lesions in the brain can affect speech. These speech issues, also known asdysarthria, can range from mild to severe. Symptoms of dysarthria can include: slurred speech “scanning” speech, where there are long pauses between words or syllables changes in the volume of speech Other common symptoms of MS can include: acute or chronic pain tremors cognitive issues involving concentration, memory, and word-finding difficulty chewing and swallowing sleep issues problems with bladder control Learn more about the symptoms of MS."
927,Multiple Sclerosis,What are the early signs of MS?,"MS can begin with mild to severe symptoms, and it can progress slowly or rapidly. Three of the most common early symptoms of MS are: Numbness and tingling that affects the arms, legs, or one side of your face:These sensations are similar to the pins-and-needles feeling you get when your foot falls asleep. However, they occur without a trigger. Uneven balance and weak legs:You may find yourself tripping easily while walking or doing some other type of physical activity. Double vision, blurry vision in one eye, or partial vision loss:These symptoms can be early indicators of MS. You may also have eye pain. These early symptoms may go away only to return later. You may go weeks, months, or even years betweenflare-ups. These symptoms can have many different causes. Even if you have these symptoms, it doesn’t necessarily mean that you have MS. Learn about the early signs of MS."
928,Multiple Sclerosis,How is MS diagnosed?,"A healthcare professional, often a neurologist, performs a neurological exam to diagnose MS. They typically also talk with you about your clinical history and order tests to confirm the diagnosis. Diagnostic testing may include: MRI scan:Using a contrast dye with theMRIallows your doctor to detect active and inactive lesions throughout your brain and spinal cord. Optical coherence tomography (OCT):In this test, a picture of the nerve layers in the back of your eye is taken to check for thinning around the optic nerve. Spinal tap (lumbar puncture):Your doctor may order aspinal tapto find abnormalities in your spinal fluid. This test can help rule out infectious diseases. It can also be used to look for oligoclonal bands (OCBs), which can be used to diagnose MS. Blood tests:Doctors orderblood teststo help eliminate the possibility of other conditions that have similar symptoms. Visual evoked potentials (VEP) test:This test stimulates the nerve pathways to analyze electrical activity in your brain.Brain stem auditory-evokedand sensory-evoked potential tests may also be used to diagnose MS. An MS diagnosis requires evidence ofdemyelinationoccurring at different times in more than one area of your brain, spinal cord, or optic nerves. Damage to the protective myelin layer around your nerves is called demyelination. It prevents your nervous system from efficiently sending signals in the areas that are affected. A diagnosis also requires ruling out other conditions that have similar symptoms, such as: Lyme disease lupus Sjögren disease Learn more about the tests used to diagnose MS."
929,Multiple Sclerosis,What are the types of MS?,"Your MS may change and evolve. You can only have one type of MS at a time, but knowing when you transition to a progressive form of MS may be difficult to pinpoint. Types of MS include: CISis a pre-MS condition involving one episode of symptoms lasting at least 24 hours. These symptoms are due to demyelination in your CNS. Although this episode is characteristic of MS, it’s not enough to prompt a diagnosis. CIS can fully resolve, and a person can have a single episode without any future episodes. If you have more than one lesion or positive oligoclonal bands (OCBs) in your spinal fluid at the time of a spinal tap, then you might be more likely to eventually be diagnosed with RRMS. If you have evidence of a previous lesion, you might be diagnosed with RRMS during the evaluation for CIS. If these lesions are absent or your spinal fluid does not show OCBs, you are less likely to receive an MS diagnosis. Relapsing-remitting MS (RRMS)involves clear relapses of disease activity followed by remissions. During remission periods, symptoms are mild or absent, and there’s mild to moderate disease progression. RRMS is the most common form of MS at diagnosis and accounts forabout 85%of all initial MS diagnoses, according to the NMSS. If you haveprimary progressive MS (PPMS), neurological function becomes progressively worse from the onset of your symptoms. However, short periods of stability can occur. The terms “active” and “not active” are sometimes used to describe disease activity with new or enhancing brain lesions. Secondary progressive MS (SPMS)occurs when RRMS transitions into the progressive form. In addition to disability or gradual worsening of function, you may still have noticeable relapses. Find out more about the different types of MS."
930,Multiple Sclerosis,What causes MS?,"If you have MS, the protective layer of myelin around some of the nerve fibers of your brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord become damaged. See illustrations that show these physiological changes. Experts think that this damage may result from an autoimmune process in which the immune system targets myelin. While more research is needed, an environmental trigger, such as a virus or toxin, may set off this process. As your immune system damages the myelin, demyelination occurs. This can go into remission as new layers of myelin form, but chronic inflammation can lead to scar tissue, which can result in lasting neurological impairment. MS is not hereditary, but havinga parent or siblingwith MS raises your risk slightly. Scientists have identified some genes that seem to increase susceptibility to developing MS, according to a review of studiespublished in 2011. Experts do not know why some people develop MS. However, several risk factors may increase the risk. These include: having a close relative with MS obesity certain infections smoking certain autoimmune disorders, such astype 1 diabetesandrheumatoid arthritis Find out more about the possible causes of MS."
931,Multiple Sclerosis,How do doctors treat MS?,"No cure is currently available for MS, but treatment options can limit relapses or slow progression. Other medications and therapies can help manage specific symptoms. DMTshelp slow the progression of MS and reduce your relapse rate. Self-injectable disease-modifying medications for RRMS includeglatiramer acetate (Copaxone)and beta interferons, such as: Avonex Betaseron Extavia Plegridy Rebif In 2020, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved Kesimpta for treatment. Kesimpta is an injectable monoclonal antibody treatment that can be self-administered. Oral medications for RRMS include: dimethyl fumarate (Tecfidera) fingolimod (Gilenya) teriflunomide (Aubagio) cladribine (Mavenclad) diroximel fumarate (Vumerity) siponimod (Mayzent) ozanimod (Zeposia) monomethyl fumerate (Bafiertam) ponesimod (Ponvory) Intravenous (IV) infusion treatmentsfor RRMS include: alemtuzumab (Lemtrada) natalizumab (Tysabri) mitoxantrone (Novantrone) Ocrelizumab (Ocrevus) In 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the first DMT for people with PPMS. This infusion drug,ocrelizumab (Ocrevus), can also be used to treat RRMS. Another drug, ozanimod (Zeposia), has recently been approved for treating CIS, RRMS, and SPMS. Not allMS medicationsare available or appropriate for every person. Talk with your doctor about which drugs are most appropriate for you and the risks and benefits of each. A doctor can prescribecorticosteroids, such asmethylprednisolone(Medrol) or Acthar Gel (ACTH), to treat relapses. Other treatments may also be targeted at easing specific symptoms to help improve your quality of life, such as helping to treat pain or bladder urgency. Because MS is different for everyone, treatment depends on your specific symptoms. Get more information on treatments for MS."
932,Multiple Sclerosis,What is the life expectancy of someone with MS?,"Most peoplewith MS have a normal life expectancy. While MS is not a terminal illness, some complications associated with it can be life threatening. Progressive types of MS generally advance faster than RRMS. People with RRMS can be in remission for many years. A lack of disability after 5 years is usually a good indicator for the future. Most people with MS don’t become severely disabled and continue to lead full lives. Take a closer look at the prognosis for people with MS."
933,Multiple Sclerosis,Can you live a regular life with MS?,"Your quality of life with MS will depend on your symptoms and how well you respond to treatment. But even though MS can change course without warning, it’s rarely fatal. Most people with MS find ways to manage their symptoms and function well. Having MS means you’ll need adoctor experienced in treating MS. If you take one of the DMTs, you’ll need to adhere to the recommended schedule. Your doctor may prescribe other medications to treat specific symptoms. Regular physical activity, such as exercise, supports your overall health, physically and mentally. If physical movement is difficult,swimmingor exercising in a swimming pool can help. Some yoga classes are designed just for people with MS. Awell-balanced dietthat’s high innutrientsand fiber can also help you manage your overall health. Your diet should mainly consist of: a variety offruitsandvegetables lean sources ofprotein, such asfishandskinless poultry whole grainsandother sources of fiber nuts legumes low fat dairy products adequate amounts ofwaterand other fluids The more nutritious your diet, the better it supports your overall health. You’ll not only feel better in the short term, but you’ll also be laying the foundation for a healthier future. It’s important that you try tolimit or avoid: saturated fat trans fat red meats foods and beverages high in sugar foods high in sodium highly processed foods If you have other medical conditions, ask your doctor if you should follow a special diet or take any dietary supplements. It’s helpful to learn how toread food labelsproperly. Foods that are high in calories but low in nutrients will not help you feel better or maintain a weight that works for you. Although studies regarding the effectiveness of complementary therapies are scarce, that does not mean these methods can’t help in some way. The following therapiesmay helpyou feel less stressed and more relaxed: meditation massage tai chi acupuncture hypnotherapy"
934,Multiple Sclerosis,What are the complications of MS?,"MS lesions can appear anywhere in your CNS and have wide-ranging effects. Many people with MS also have: depression anxiety some degree of cognitive impairment muscle spasticity or stiffness muscle atrophy or thinning If you have other medical conditions, MS can have a more substantial impact on your overall health. If you have mobility issues, falling may increase your risk ofbone fractures. Other conditions, such asarthritisandosteoporosis, can complicate matters. Mobility issues can lead to a lack of physical activity, which can cause other health problems. Fatigue and mobility issues may also have an effect on mental health. Discover more effects of MS."
935,Multiple Sclerosis,What are the statistics on MS?,"The National Institutes of Health (NIH) reports that around400,000 peoplein the United States have MS. Other things you should know: NMSS reports that most people diagnosed with RRMS arebetween ages 20 and 50at the time of their diagnosis. Overall, research indicates that MS ismore common in femalesthan males. NMSS reports that RRMS specifically isthree timesmore common in females than males. PPMS rates in females and males are roughly equal. Research shows that people who relocate to a new locationbefore age 15 yearsgenerally acquire the MS risk factors associated with the new location, compared with those relocating after age 15 years. Canada has one of the highest rates of MS in the world. Rates of MS tend to be lower in places closer to the equator. This may be due tosunlightandvitamin Dexposure. Check out more MS facts and statistics here."
936,Multiple Sclerosis,Takeaway,"MS is a lifelong condition. You’ll face unique challenges that can change over time. It’s helpful for you to discuss your concerns with your doctor. Doing so, enables you to learn all you can about MS and to discover what makes you feel your best. Many people with MS even choose to share their challenges and coping strategies through in-person oronlinesupport groups. You can also try Healthline’s free MS Buddy app to share advice and support in an open environment. Download it foriPhoneorAndroid. Read this article in Spanish."
937,Muscle Aches,Overview,"Because there’s muscle tissue in nearly all parts of the body, this type of pain can be felt practically anywhere. However, there’s no single cause for muscle aches and pains. Muscle aches (myalgia) are extremely common. Almost everyone has experienced discomfort in their muscles at some point. While overuse or injury is common, there are other possible explanations for ongoing discomfort."
938,Muscle Aches,What are the most common causes of muscle aches?,"Often, people who experience muscle aches can easily pinpoint the cause. This is because most instances of myalgia result from too muchstress,tension, orphysical activity. Some common causes include: muscle tension in one or more areas of the body overusing the muscle during physical activity injuring the musclewhile engaging in physically demanding work or exercise skipping warmups and cool downs"
939,Muscle Aches,What types of medical conditions can cause muscle pain?,"Not all muscle aches are related to stress, tension, and physical activity. Some medical explanations for myalgia include: fibromyalgia, especially if aches and pains last longer than 3 months chronic fatigue syndrome myofascial pain syndrome, which causes inflammation in muscular connective tissues called fascia infections, such as theflu,polio, or bacterial infections autoimmune disorderssuch aslupus,dermatomyositis, and polymyositis use of certain medications or drugs, such asstatins,ACE inhibitors, or cocaine thyroid problems, such ashypothyroidismorhyperthyroidism hypokalemia(low potassium)"
940,Muscle Aches,Easing muscle aches at home,"Muscle aches often respond well to home treatment. Some measures you can take to relieve muscle discomfort from injuries and overuse include: resting the area of the body where you’re experiencing aches and pains taking anover-the-counter pain reliever, such as ibuprofen (Advil) applyingiceto the affected area to help relieve pain and reduce inflammation You should use ice for1 to 3 daysfollowing a strain or sprain, and apply heat for any pain that remains after 3 days. Other measures that may provide relief from muscle pain include: gentlystretchingthe muscles avoiding high-impact activities until after the muscle pain goes away avoidingweight liftingsessions until the muscle pain is resolved giving yourself time to rest doingstress-relievingactivities and exercises such as yoga and meditation to relieve tension ibuprofen ice packs hot packs resistance bandsfor stretching yoga essentials"
941,Muscle Aches,When to see a doctor about muscle aches,"Muscle aches aren’t always harmless, and in some instances, home treatment isn’t enough to address the underlying cause. Myalgia can also be a sign that something is seriously wrong in your body. You should see your doctor for: pain that doesn’t go away after a few days of home treatment severe muscle pain that arises without a clear cause muscle pain that occurs along with arash muscle pain that occurs after atick bite myalgia accompanied by redness or swelling pain that occurs soon after a medication change pain that occurs with an elevated temperature The following can be a sign of a medical emergency. Get to the hospital as soon as possible if you experience any of the following along with aching muscles: a sudden onset ofwater retentionor a reduction in urine volume difficulty swallowing vomitingor running a fever trouble catching your breath stiffnessin your neck area muscles that areweak an inability to move the affected area of the body If you need help finding a primary care doctor, you can browse doctors in your area through theHealthline FindCare tool."
942,Muscle Aches,Tips for preventing sore muscles,"If your muscle pain is caused by tension or physical activity, take these measures to lower your risk of developing muscle pain in the future: Stretchyour muscles before engaging in physical activity and after workouts. Incorporate a warmup and a cooldown into all of your exercise sessions, around 5 minutes each. Stayhydrated, especially on days when you’re active. Engage in regular exercise to help promote optimal muscle tone. Get up and stretch regularly if you work at a desk or in an environment that puts you at risk for muscle strain or tension."
943,Muscle Aches,Takeaway,"Occasional muscle aches and pains are normal, especially if you’re active or are new to exercise. Listen to your body and stop doing an activity if your muscles start hurting. Ease into new activities to avoid muscle injuries. Your sore muscles might be due to something other than tension and physical activity. In this case, your doctor will be the best person to advise you on how to fully resolve your muscle pain. The first priority will be to treat the primary condition. As a rule of thumb, you should see your doctor if your muscle pain doesn’t resolve after a few days’ worth of homecare and rest."
944,Musculoskeletal Disorders,Overview,"Musculoskeletal disorders are conditions that affect muscles, bones, joints, and connective tissue. They can be present at birth or develop as a result of injury or disease. Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are conditions that can affect your muscles, bones, and joints. MSDs include: tendinitis carpal tunnel syndrome osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis (RA) fibromyalgia bone fractures MSDs are common. And your risk of developing them increases with age. The severity of MSDs can vary. In some cases, they cause pain and discomfort that interferes with everyday activities. Early diagnosis and treatment may help ease symptoms and improve long-term outlook."
945,Musculoskeletal Disorders,What are the symptoms of MSDs?,"Symptoms of MSDs can include: recurrent pain stiff joints swelling dull aches They can affect any major area of your musculoskeletal system, including the following: neck shoulders wrists back hips legs knees feet In some cases, the symptoms of MSDs interfere with everyday activities like walking or typing. You may develop a limited range of motion or have trouble completing routine tasks."
946,Musculoskeletal Disorders,What causes MSDs?,"Your risk of developing MSDs is affected by: age occupation activity level lifestyle family history Certain activities can cause wear and tear on your musculoskeletal system, leading to MSDs. These include: sitting in the same position at a computer every day engaging in repetitive motions lifting heavy weights maintaining poor posture at work"
947,Musculoskeletal Disorders,How are MSDs diagnosed?,"Your treatment plan will vary depending on the cause of your symptoms. So it’s important to get an accurate diagnosis. If you’re experiencing symptoms of an MSD, make an appointment with your doctor. To diagnose your condition, they’ll likely perform aphysical exam. They will check for: pain redness swelling muscle weakness muscle atrophy They may also test your reflexes. Unusual reflexes may indicate nerve damage. Your doctor may also order imaging tests, such asX-raysor MRI scans. These tests can help them examine your bones and soft tissues. They may also order blood tests to check for rheumatic diseases, such as RA."
948,Musculoskeletal Disorders,How are MSDs treated?,"Your doctor will recommend a treatment plan based on your diagnosis and the severity of your symptoms. To address occasional pain, they may suggest moderate exercise and over-the-counter medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. For more severe symptoms, they may prescribe medications to reduce inflammation and pain. In some cases, they may recommend physical therapy, occupational therapy, or both. These therapies can help you learn how to manage your pain and discomfort, maintain your strength and range of motion, and adjust your everyday activities and environments."
949,Musculoskeletal Disorders,How can you prevent MSDs?,"Your risk of developing MSDs increases with age. Your muscles, bones, and joints naturally deteriorate as you get older. But that doesn’t mean that MSDs are inevitable. By taking care of your body throughout adulthood, you can lower your risk of developing these disorders. It’s crucial to develop healthy lifestyle habits now. Regular strengthening exercises and stretching can help keep your bones, joints, and muscles strong. It’s also important to complete everyday activities in safe ways. Maintain a tall posture to prevent back pain, be careful when picking up heavy objects, and try to keep repetitive motions to a minimum. Ask your doctor for more information about how you can maintain a healthy musculoskeletal system and lower your risk of MSDs."
950,Nausea,Overview,"Nausea and vomiting can be caused by many things, like pain, illness, and pregnancy. Seek medical care if your nausea and vomiting lasts longer than a week. Vomitingis an uncontrollable reflex that expels the contents of the stomach through the mouth. It’s also called “being sick” or “throwing up.”Nauseais a term that describes the feeling that you might vomit but aren’t actually vomiting. Both nausea and vomiting are very common symptoms and can be caused by a wide range of factors. They occur in both children and adults, although they’re probably most common in pregnant women and people undergoing cancer treatments."
951,Nausea,What causes nausea and vomiting?,"Nausea and vomiting may occur together or separately. They can be caused by a number of physical and psychological conditions. The most common causes of nausea are intense pain — usually from an injury or illness — and the first trimester ofpregnancy. There are also a number of other relatively common causes, including: motion sickness emotional stress indigestion food poisoning viruses exposure to chemical toxins If you havegallstones, you’re also likely to feel nauseated. You may find that certain smells bring on the feeling of nausea. This is a very common symptom during thefirst trimester of pregnancy, although it can also occur in people who aren’t pregnant. Pregnancy-induced nausea usually goes away by the second or third trimester. The most common causes of vomiting in children are viral infections and food poisoning. However, vomiting can also be caused by: severe motion sickness coughing high fevers overeating In very young infants, blocked intestines can also cause persistent vomiting. The intestines may become blocked by abnormal muscular thickening,hernia, gallstones, or tumors. This is uncommon but should be investigated if unexplained vomiting occurs in an infant. Most adults rarely vomit. When it does occur, a bacterial or viral infection or a type of food poisoning usually causes vomiting. In some cases, vomiting can also be the result of other illnesses, especially if they lead to aheadacheor highfever. Chronic, or long-term, stomach conditions can often cause nausea and vomiting. These conditions can come along with other symptoms, such asdiarrhea,constipation, andstomach pain. These chronic conditions include food intolerances, such asceliac diseaseand dairy protein andlactose intolerance. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)is a common stomach condition that causes bloating, nausea, vomiting, heartburn, fatigue, and cramping. It occurs when parts of the gut become overactive. Doctors usually diagnose IBS by identifying symptoms and ruling out other stomach and bowel conditions. Crohn’s diseaseis an inflammatory bowel disease that commonly affects the intestines, though it can occur anywhere in the digestive tract. Crohn’s disease is an autoimmune condition in which the body attacks its own healthy gut tissue, causing inflammation, nausea, vomiting, and pain. Doctors usually diagnose Crohn’s disease using acolonoscopy, a procedure that uses a small camera to explore the colon. Sometimes they also need a stool sample to help diagnose the condition. Certain lifestyle choices can increase your chance of experiencing nausea and vomiting. Consuming a large amount ofalcoholcan cause damage to the lining of the gut. Alcohol can also react with stomach acid. Both of these will cause nausea and vomiting. In some cases, excessive alcohol consumption can also cause bleeding in the digestive tract. An eating disorder is when a person adjusts their eating habits and behaviors based on an unhealthy body image. It can cause nausea and vomiting. Bulimiais an eating disorder in which a person induces vomiting deliberately to purge the stomach of any consumed food. People withanorexiamay also feel nausea due to starvation and excess stomach acid. Though rare, vomiting can sometimes occur as a symptom of a more serious condition, including: meningitis appendicitis concussion abrain tumor migraines If you’re persistently vomiting, go see your doctor."
952,Nausea,Emergency care,"Seek medical care if you have nausea or are vomiting for more than a week. Most cases of vomiting clear up within 6 to 24 hours after the first episode. Seek emergency care for any child under 6 years old who: has both vomiting and diarrhea hasprojectile vomiting is showing symptoms ofdehydration, like wrinkled skin, irritability, a weak pulse, or reduced consciousness has been vomiting for more than two or three hours has a fever of above 100°F (38°C) hasn’t urinated in more than six hours Seek emergency care for children over 6 years old if: vomiting has lasted for more than 24 hours there are symptoms of dehydration the child hasn’t urinated in more than six hours the child appearsconfusedorlethargic the child has a fever higher than 102°F (39°C) Seek emergency medical care if you have any of the following symptoms: a severe headache a stiff neck lethargy confusion blood in the vomit a rapid pulse rapid breathing a fever of over 102°F (39°C) decreased responsiveness severe or persistentabdominal pain"
953,Nausea,Treating nausea and vomiting,"You can use a number of methods to relieve nausea and vomiting, including home remedies and medications. To treat nausea at home: Consume only light, plain foods, such as bread and crackers. Avoid any foods that have strong flavors, are very sweet, or are greasy or fried. Drink cold liquids. Avoid any activity after eating. Drink a cup ofginger tea. Eat smaller, more frequent meals. Drink a large amount of clear fluids to remain hydrated, but consume it in small sips at a time. Avoid solid foods of any kind until vomiting stops. Rest. Avoid using medications that may upset your stomach, such asnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugsorcorticosteroids. Use an oral rehydration solution to replace lost electrolytes. Before prescribing medication, your doctor will ask you questions about when the nausea and vomiting began and when it’s at its worst. They may also ask you about your eating habits and whether anything makes the vomiting and nausea better or worse. A number of prescription medications can control nausea and vomiting, including medications you can use during pregnancy. These includepromethazine(Phenergan), diphenhydramine (Benadryl), trimethobenzamide (Tigan), and ondansetron (Zofran). If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
954,Nausea,Potential complications of persistent vomiting,"Most nausea and vomiting will clear up on its own, unless you have an underlying chronic condition. However, persistent vomiting can cause dehydration andmalnutrition. You may also find that your hair and nails become weak and brittle, and that constant vomiting decays your tooth enamel."
955,Nausea,How can nausea and vomiting be prevented?,"You can avoid nausea by eating smaller meals throughout the day, eating slowly, and resting after eating. Some people find that avoiding certain food groups and spicy foods prevents nausea. If you start to feel nauseated, eat plain crackers before getting up and try to consume a high-protein food, such as cheese, lean meat, or nuts, before you go to sleep. If you’re vomiting, try to drink small amounts of a sugary liquid, such as a soda or fruit juice. Drinking ginger ale or eating ginger can help settle your stomach. Avoid acidic juices, such as orange juice. They may upset your stomach further. Over-the-counter medications, such asmeclizine(Bonine) and dimenhydrinate (Dramamine), can lessen the effects of motion sickness. Limit snacks during car rides and look straight out of a front window if you’re prone to motion sickness."
956,Neck Pain,Overview,"Neck pain or stiffness is usually a result of poor posture or an awkward sleeping position. However, it can sometimes indicate a serious injury or an underlying health condition. Your neck is made up of bones, ligaments, and muscles, which support your neck and allow for motion. Any abnormalities, inflammation, or injury to your neck can cause pain or stiffness. Lifestyle measures, such as improving your posture or sleeping position, can typically help reduce symptoms. However, if your symptoms are severe, continue for more than a week, or are accompanied by other symptoms, you should speak with a healthcare professional immediately."
957,Neck Pain,What does neck pain feel like?,"Neck pain symptoms can range in severity and duration. They may be mild and not interfere much with daily activities, or they may be severe. Symptoms of neck pain caninclude: Stiff neck.People with neck pain often describe feeling as though their neck is“stiff” or “stuck.”Neck pain can sometimes cause a decreased range of motion. Sharp pain.Neck pain may feel like sharp or “stabbing” pain that is localized to one area. Pain when moving.Neck pain is often exacerbated by moving, twisting, or extending your cervical spine, either from side to side or up and down. Radiating pain or numbness.Your neck pain may radiate to your head, trunk, shoulders, and arms. If your neck pain involves the compression of a nerve, you may feel numbness, tingling, or weakness in either of your arms or hands. Talk with a doctor if you experience any of these symptoms. Headache.Pain that starts in your neck may also produce a headache called a cervicogenic headache. Neck pain with a headache may also be a symptom of amigraine headache. Pain when palpated.Neck pain may increase if your cervical spine is palpated (physically examined)."
958,Neck Pain,Causes of neck pain,"Neck pain or stiffness can happen for avariety of reasons. This is usually from activities and behaviors such as: poor posture working at a desk for too long without changing position sleeping with your neck in a bad position jerking your neck during exercise The neck is particularly vulnerable to injury, especially in falls, car accidents, and sports, where the muscles and ligaments of the neck are forced to move outside of their normal range. Neck paincan alsobe a symptom of aheart attack. It often presents with other symptoms of a heart attack, such as: shortness of breath sweating nausea vomiting armorjawpain If your neck hurts and you have other symptoms of heart attack, call 911 or go to the emergency room immediately. Meningitisis an inflammation of the thin tissue that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. It can cause symptomssuch as: stiff neck headache nausea vomiting sensitivity to light fever Meningitis can be fatal and is a medical emergency If you have the symptoms of meningitis, seek medical help immediately. Other causes of neck pain include the following: rheumatoid arthritis osteoporosis fibromyalgia spondylosis, or osteoarthritis of the neck herniated cervical disc spinal stenosis"
959,Neck Pain,How to ease neck pain at home,"If you have minor neck pain or stiffness, there areseveral simple optionsthat can help provide relief: Apply ice for the first few days. If the pain persists, try applying heat with aheating pad, hot compress, or by taking a hot shower. Takeover-the-counter pain relievers, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Take a few days off from sports, activities that aggravate your symptoms, and heavy lifting. When you resume usual activity, do so slowly as your symptoms ease. Exercise your neck every day. Slowly stretch your head in side-to-side and up-and-down motions. Practice good posture. Change your position often. Don’t stand or sit in one position for too long. Don’t use a neck brace or collar without a doctor’s approval. If you don’t use them properly, they can make your symptoms worse."
960,Neck Pain,How neck pain is treated,"Treatment for neck paindepends on its cause. In addition to a thorough history and physical exam by a doctor, you may also need one or more of the following imaging studies and tests to help a doctor determine the cause of your neck pain and make a diagnosis: blood test X-ray CT scan MRI scan electromyography, which allows a doctor to check the health of your muscles and the nerves that control your muscles lumbar puncture(spinal tap) Depending on the results, a doctor may refer you to a specialist. Treatment for neck pain may include: ice and heat therapy exercise, stretching, and physical therapy pain medication corticosteroid injections muscle relaxants neck collar antibiotics if you have an infection hospital treatment, if a condition such as meningitis or heart attack is the cause surgery, in rare cases Alternative therapies that may help include: acupuncture chiropractic treatment massage transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) It’s important to ensure you’re seeing a licensed professional when using these methods."
961,Neck Pain,When to see a doctor,"If you are experiencing neck pain that isn’t going away, consider speaking with a doctor. They can perform a physical exam and take your complete medical history to identify any underlying causes. Be prepared to tell them about the specifics of your symptoms and all prescription and over-the-counter (OTC) medications and supplements you’ve been taking. Even if it doesn’t seem related, you should let the doctor know about any recent injuries or accidents you’ve had, too. If symptoms persist for more than a week, speak with a doctor. You should also see a doctor if you have: severe neck pain without apparent cause a lump in your neck fever headache swollen glands nausea vomiting trouble swallowingor breathing weakness numbness tingling pain that radiates down your arms or legs inability to move your arms or hands inability to touch your chin to your chest bladder or bowel dysfunction If you’ve been in an accident or fall and your neck hurts, seek medical care immediately."
962,Neck Pain,The bottom line,"Many people experience neck pain because of poor posture and muscle strain. In these cases, your neck pain should go away if you practice good posture and rest your neck muscles when they’re sore. Make an appointment with a doctor if your neck pain isn’t improving with home treatments."
963,Nosebleed,Overview,"Many things can cause a nosebleed, from dry air to high blood pressure. While most nosebleeds can be handled at home, talk with a doctor if you cannot stop the bleeding or experience frequent nosebleeds. Nosebleeds are common. They may be scary, but they rarely indicate a serious medical problem. The nose contains many blood vessels, which are located close to the surface in the front and back of the nose. They’re very fragile and bleed easily. Nosebleeds are common in adults andchildren between the ages of 3 and 10. There are two kinds of nosebleeds. Ananterior nosebleedoccurs when the blood vessels in the front of the nose break and bleed. Aposterior nosebleedoccurs in the back or the deepest part of the nose. In this case, blood flows down the back of the throat. Posterior nosebleeds can be dangerous."
964,Nosebleed,Causes of nosebleeds,"There are many causes of nosebleeds. A sudden or infrequent nosebleed is rarely serious. If you have frequent nosebleeds, you could have a more serious problem. Dry air is the most common cause of nosebleeds. Living in a dry climate and using a central heating system can dry out thenasal membranes, which are tissues inside the nose. This dryness causes crusting inside the nose. Crusting may itch or become irritated. If your nose is scratched or picked, it can bleed. Takingantihistaminesanddecongestantsforallergies,colds, orsinus problemscan also dry out the nasal membranes and cause nosebleeds. Frequent nose blowing is another cause of nosebleeds. Other common causes of nosebleeds include: foreign object stuck in the nose chemical irritants allergic reaction injury to the nose repeatedsneezing picking the nose cold air upper respiratory infection large doses ofaspirin Other causes of nosebleeds include: high blood pressure bleeding disorders blood clotting disorders cancer Most nosebleeds don’t require medical attention. However, you should seek medical attention if your nosebleed lasts longer than 20 minutes, or if it occurs after an injury. This may be a sign of a posterior nosebleed, which is more serious. Injuries that might cause a nosebleed include a fall, a car accident, or a punch in the face. Nosebleeds that occur after an injury may indicate abroken nose,skull fracture, orinternal bleeding."
965,Nosebleed,Diagnosing a nosebleed,"If you seek medical attention for a nosebleed, your doctor will conduct aphysical examinationto determine a cause. They’ll check your nose for signs of a foreign object. They’ll also ask questions about your medical history and current medications. Tell your doctor about any other symptoms you’ve and any recent injuries. There’s no single test to determine the cause of a nosebleed. However, your doctor might use diagnostic tests to find the cause. These tests include: complete blood count (CBC), which is a blood test to check for blood disorders partial thromboplastin time (PTT), which is a blood test that checks how long it takes for your blood to clot nasalendoscopy CT scanof the nose X-rayof the face andnose"
966,Nosebleed,How to treat a nosebleed,"Treatment for nosebleeds will vary depending on the type and cause of the nosebleed. Read on to find out about treatments for different nosebleeds. If you have an anterior nosebleed, you bleed from the front of your nose, usually a nostril. You can try to treat an anterior nosebleed at home. While sitting up, squeeze the soft part of your nose. Make sure that your nostrils are fully closed. Keep your nostrils closed for 10 minutes, lean forward slightly, and breathe through your mouth. Don’t lie down when trying to stop a nosebleed. Lying down can result in swallowing blood and can irritate your stomach. Release your nostrils after 10 minutes and check to see if the bleeding has stopped. Repeat these steps if bleeding continues. You can also apply acold compressover the bridge of your nose or use anasal spray decongestantto close off the small blood vessels. See your doctor immediately if you’re unable to stop a nosebleed on your own. You might have a posterior nosebleed that requires more invasive treatment. If you have a posterior nosebleed, you bleed from the back of your nose. The blood also tends to flow from the back of your nose down your throat. Posterior nosebleeds are less common and often more serious than anterior nosebleeds. Posterior nosebleeds shouldn’t be treated at home. Contact your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room (ER) if you think you have a posterior nosebleed. If a foreign object is the cause, your doctor can remove the object. A medical technique calledcauterizationcan also stop persistent or frequent nosebleeds. This involves your doctor burning the blood vessels in your nose with either a heating device or silver nitrate, a compound used to remove tissue. Your doctor may pack your nose with cotton, gauze, or foam. They may also use a balloon catheter to apply pressure to your blood vessels and stop the bleeding."
967,Nosebleed,How to prevent nosebleeds,"There are several ways to prevent nosebleeds. Use ahumidifierin your house to keep the air moist. Avoid picking your nose. Limit your intake ofaspirin, which can thin your blood and contribute to nosebleeds. Discuss this with your doctor first because the benefits of taking aspirin might outweigh the risks. Useantihistaminesanddecongestantsin moderation. These can dry out the nose. Use a saline spray or gel to keep the nasal passages moist."
968,Nosebleed,Takeaway,"Nosebleeds are common and not usually serious. Most are anterior nosebleeds and can often be treated at home. These usually occur suddenly and don’t last long. They result from many causes, especially dry air and repeated scratching or picking of the nose. If you can’t stop the bleeding from your anterior nosebleed, you should call your doctor immediately. A posterior nosebleed can be more serious. If you think you might have a posterior nosebleed, contact your doctor immediately or go to the ER. Keeping the air humidified in your home, avoiding picking your nose, and using nasal mists to keep your nasal passages moist are good ways to help prevent nosebleeds."
969,Obesity,Overview,"Obesity is a long-term (chronic) health condition that progresses over time. Obesity is defined by excess body fat (adipose tissue) that may impair health. Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation that takes a person’s weight and height into account to measure body size. Doctors typically use it as a screening tool for obesity. In adults, obesity is often defined as having aBMIof30 or more, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Obesity is associated with a higher risk of developing serious diseases, including: type 2 diabetes heart disease cancer While BMI tends to relate to the level of body fat, it has some limitations as a measurement. According to theCDC, “Factors such as age, sex, ethnicity, and muscle mass can influence the relationship between BMI and body fat. Also, BMI doesn’t distinguish between excess fat, muscle, or bone mass, nor does it provide any indication of the distribution of fat among individuals.” Despite these limitations, BMI continues to be widely used as a way to measure body size. This is because it’s less expensive than other methods. It’s worth noting that the effects ofweight discriminationcan also contribute to negative health effects. Obesity is common. The CDC estimates that41.9%of people in the United States had obesity from 2017 to March 2020. Keep reading to learn more about obesity causes, risk factors, and treatment. You’ll notice that the language used to share stats and other data points is pretty binary, fluctuating between the use of “men” and “women.” Although we typically avoid language like this, specificity is key when reporting on research participants and clinical findings. Unfortunately, the studies and surveys referenced in this article didn’t report data on, or include, participants who were transgender,nonbinary,gender nonconforming,genderqueer,agender, or genderless."
970,Obesity,What are the symptoms of obesity?,There are no specific symptoms associated with obesity. A doctor may diagnose obesity based on the following factors: excess amounts of abdominal (visceral) fat that are higher than the amounts of body fat in other areas a waist circumference of greater than40 inches for men or 35 inches for women a BMIover 30
971,Obesity,How is obesity classified?,"The followingclassesare used for adults who are at least 20 years old: For a doctor to diagnose obesity in achild over 2 years old or a teen, their BMI has to be at or above the95th percentile. A BMI at or above the 95th percentile is higher than the BMI of 95% of people with the same age and sex assigned at birth. From 2015 to 2016,18.5%(or about 13.7 million) of U.S. youth between 2 and 19 years old were considered to have clinical obesity."
972,Obesity,What causes obesity?,"Taking in more calories than you burnin daily activity and exercise — on a long-term basis — can lead to obesity. Over time, these extra calories add up and cause weight gain. But it’s not always just about calories in and calories out or having a sedentary lifestyle. While those are indeed causes of obesity, some causes you can’t control. Common specific causes of obesityinclude: genetics, which can affect how your body processes food into energy and how fat is stored growing older, which can lead to less muscle mass and a slower metabolic rate, making it easier to gain weight not sleeping enough, which can lead to hormonal changes that make you feel hungrier and crave certain high calorie foods high stress, which may trigger the production of hormones that cause you to eat more and store more fat pregnancy, as weight gained during pregnancy may be difficult to lose and might eventually lead to obesity Certain health conditions can also lead to weight gain, which may lead to obesity. These include: metabolic syndrome, a group of risk factors that include high blood pressure, high blood sugar, high levels of triglycerides, low levels of HDL cholesterol, and excess fat around your waist that raise your chance of developing certain serious health conditions polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), a condition that causes animbalanceof hormones called androgens Prader-Willi syndrome, a rare condition present at birth that causes excessive hunger Cushing syndrome, a condition caused by havinghigh levels of cortisol(the stress hormone) in your system hypothyroidism(underactive thyroid), a condition in which thethyroid glanddoesn’t produce enough of certain important hormones osteoarthritis (OA)and other conditions that cause pain that may lead to reduced activity"
973,Obesity,Who is at risk of obesity?,"A complex mix of factors can increase a person’s risk of obesity. Some people have genes that make it more likely for them to gain weight and body fat. Your environment at home, at school, and in your community can all influence how and what you eat, as well as how active you are. You may be at a higher risk of developing obesity if you: live in a neighborhood withlimited nutritious food optionsor withmanyhigh calorie food options, like fast-food restaurants haven’t learned to cook balanced meals think you can’t afford more nutritious foods haven’t founda good place to play, walk, or exercise in your neighborhood Depressioncan sometimes lead to weight gain, as some people may turn to food for emotional comfort. Having disturbed sleeping patternscan make you eat moreduring the day, especially foods high in fat and carbohydrates. If you smoke,quitting smokingis beneficial to your health, but quitting may lead to weight gain too. In some people, it may lead toexcessiveweight gain. For that reason, it’s important to focus on diet and exercise while you’re quitting, at least after the initial withdrawal period. Certain medications can also raise your risk of weight gain. These medications can include: corticosteroids, which may treat autoimmune disease antidepressants antipsychotics beta-blockers, which may treat high blood pressure"
974,Obesity,How is obesity diagnosed?,"BMI provides a rough calculation of a person’s weight in relation to their height. Other more accurate measures ofbody fatand where body fat is located include: skinfold thickness tests waist-to-hip comparisons dual energy radiographic absorptiometry (DEXA) scans other screening tests, such asultrasounds,CT scans, andMRI scans A doctor may also order certain tests to help diagnose obesity-related health risks. These may include: blood teststo examinecholesterolandglucoselevels liver function tests diabetes screening thyroid tests heart tests, such as anelectrocardiogram(ECG or EKG) A measurement ofthe fat around your waistis also a good predictor of your risk of developing obesity-related diseases."
975,Obesity,What are the complications of obesity?,"Obesity can lead to more than weight gain. Having a high ratio of body fat to muscle puts strain on your bones as well as your internal organs. It also increasesinflammationin the body, which may be a risk factor for cancer. Obesity is also amajor risk factorfor type 2 diabetes. Researchers have linked obesity to manyhealth complications, some of which can be life threatening if not treated: type 2 diabetes heart disease high blood pressure certain cancers (breast,colon, andendometrial) stroke gallbladder disease fatty liver disease high cholesterol sleep apneaand other breathing problems arthritis infertility"
976,Obesity,How is obesity treated?,"If you have obesity and would like to lose weight but have been unable to do so on your own, medical help is available. Start with aprimary care physician, who may be able to refer you to a weight specialist in your area. A doctor may also want to work with you aspart of a teamhelping you lose weight. That team might include adietitian,therapist, or other healthcare staff. The doctor will work with you on making needed lifestyle changes. Sometimes, they may recommend medications or weight loss surgery as well.Learn more about treatment for obesity. Doctors typically recommend lifestyle and behavioral changes to help children with obesity lose weight. In some cases, doctorsmay prescribemedication."
977,Obesity,Which lifestyle and behavioral changes can help with weight loss?,"A healthcare team can recommend food choices and help developa nutritious eating planthat works for you. The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseasessuggeststhat an eating plan that you can stick to long-term may help you lose weight and maintain a moderate weight. A structured exercise program andincreased daily activity— between150 and 300 minutesa week — will help build up your strength,endurance, andmetabolism. Counseling orsupport groupsmay also identify triggers and help you cope with issues relating to: anxiety depression emotional eating"
978,Obesity,Which medications are prescribed for weight loss?,"A doctor may also prescribe certain prescription weight loss medications in addition to eating and exercise plans. Doctors may prescribe medications if other methods of weight loss haven’t worked and if you have a BMI of 27 or more in addition to obesity-related health issues. Prescription weight loss medications either prevent the absorption of fat or suppress appetite. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the following medications for short-term use (up to 12 weeks): phentermine/topiramate(Qsymia) naltrexone/bupropion(Contrave) liraglutide (Saxenda) semaglutide (Ozempic,Wegovy,Rybelsus) orlistat (Alli, Xenical), the only one that’s FDA-approved for use inchildren 12 years old and older These drugs may have unpleasant side effects for some people but may have more serious side effects for others. For example, orlistat can lead to the unpleasant side effects of oily and frequent bowel movements, bowel urgency, and gas. But liraglutide and semaglutide may increase the risk ofthyroid cancerfor people with a personal or family history. It’s important to inform the prescribing doctor about your medical history before beginning any of these medications. The doctor will typically monitor you closely to manage side effects and reduce your risks."
979,Obesity,What are the types of weight loss surgery?,"Weight loss surgery is commonly called bariatric surgery. This type of surgery limits how much food you can comfortably eat or prevents your body from absorbing food and calories. Sometimes it can do both. Weight loss surgery isn’t a quick fix. It’s a major surgery and can have serious risks. Afterward, people who undergo surgery will need to change how they eat and how much they eat, or they risk getting sick. However, nonsurgical options aren’t always effective at helping people with obesity lose weight and reduce their risk of comorbidities. Types of weight loss surgery include: Gastric bypass surgery:In thisprocedure, a surgeon creates a small pouch at the top of your stomach that connects directly to your small intestine. Food and liquids go through the pouch and into the intestine, bypassing most of the stomach. It’s also known as Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) surgery. Laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB):LAGB separates your stomach into two pouches using a band. Gastric sleeve surgery:Thisprocedureremoves part of your stomach. Biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch:This procedure removes most of your stomach. For decades, experts recommended that adult candidates for weight loss surgery have a BMI of at least 35 (classes 2 and 3). However, in 2018 guidelines, theAmerican Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS)endorsed weight loss surgery for adults with BMIs of 30 up to 35 (class 1) who: have related comorbidities, especially type 2 diabetes haven’t seen long-term results from nonsurgical treatments, such as eating and lifestyle changes For individuals with class 1 obesity, surgery is most effective for thosebetween the ages of 18 and 65 years. Some people may have to lose weight before surgery can be approved. Additionally, they’ll normally undergo counseling to ensure that they’re both emotionally prepared for the surgery and the lifestyle changes that it’ll require. Only a few surgical centers in the United States perform these types of procedures on children under 18 years old."
980,Obesity,How can you prevent obesity?,"Due to a dramatic increase in obesity and obesity-related diseases, communities, states, and the federal government are putting an emphasis on healthierfood choicesandactivitiesto help prevent obesity and treat people with overweight and obesity. On a personal level, you can helpprevent weight gain and obesityby: getting regular moderate exerciselikewalking,swimming, orbikingfor 20 to 30 minutes every day eating a balanced, heart-healthy dietcomposed of nutritious foods, likefruits,vegetables,whole grains, andlean protein eating high calorie foods and those high insaturated and trans fatsin moderation"
981,Obesity,Takeaway,"Obesity is a chronic medical condition caused by excess visceral fat. It may raise your risk of developing multiple health conditions, including heart disease and diabetes. Treatment can include lifestyle changes and medication. In some cases, it can involve surgery."
982,Oral Cancer,Overview,"Oral cancer is cancer that develops in the tissues of the mouth or throat. It belongs to a larger group of cancers called head and neck cancers. Most develop in the squamous cells found in your mouth, tongue, and lips. More than53,000new cases of oral cancer are diagnosed each year in the United States, occurring most often in people over 40 years old. Oral cancers are most often discovered after they’ve spread to the lymph nodes of the neck. Early detection is key to surviving oral cancer. Learn about what raises your risk, its stages, and more."
983,Oral Cancer,Types of oral cancers,Oral cancers include cancers of the: lips tongue inner lining of the cheek gums floor of the mouth hard and soft palate Your dentist is often the first healthcare provider to notice signs of oral cancer. Gettingbiannual dental checkupscan keep your dentist up to date on the health of your mouth.
984,Oral Cancer,Risk factors for developing oral cancer,"One of the biggest risk factors for oral cancer istobacco use. This includes smoking cigarettes, cigars, and pipes, as well as chewing tobacco. People who consume large amounts of alcohol and tobacco are at an even greater risk, especially when both products are used on a regular basis. Other risk factors include: human papillomavirus (HPV) infection chronic facial sun exposure a previous diagnosis of oral cancer a family history of oral or other types of cancer a weakened immune system poor nutrition genetic syndromes being male Men aretwice as likelyto get oral cancer as women are."
985,Oral Cancer,What are symptoms of oral cancer?,"Symptoms of oral cancer include: asore on your lip or mouththat won’t heal a mass or growth anywhere in your mouth bleeding from your mouth loose teeth pain or difficulty swallowing trouble wearing dentures alump in your neck anearachethat won’t go away dramatic weight loss lower lip, face, neck, orchin numbness white, red and white, or red patches in or on your mouth or lips asore throat jaw pain or stiffness tongue pain Some of these symptoms, such as a sore throat or an earache, may indicate other conditions. However, if you notice any of these symptoms, especially if they don’t go away or you have more than one at a time, visit your dentist or doctor as soon as possible.Find out what mouth cancer looks like here."
986,Oral Cancer,How is oral cancer diagnosed?,"First, your doctor or dentist will perform a physical exam. This includes closely examining the roof and floor of your mouth, the back of your throat, tongue, and cheeks, and the lymph nodes in your neck. If your doctor cannot determine why you’re having your symptoms, you may be referred to an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist. If your doctor finds any tumors, growths, or suspicious lesions, they’ll perform a brush biopsy or atissue biopsy. A brush biopsy is a painless test that collects cells from the tumor by brushing them onto a slide. A tissue biopsy involves removing a piece of the tissue so it can be examined under a microscope for cancerous cells. In addition, your doctor may perform one or more of the following tests: X-raysto see if cancer cells have spread to the jaw, chest, or lungs aCT scanto reveal any tumors in your mouth, throat, neck, lungs, or elsewhere in your body aPET scanto determine if the cancer has traveled to lymph nodes or other organs aMRI scanto show a more accurate image of the head and neck, and determine the extent or stage of the cancer anendoscopyto examine the nasal passages, sinuses, inner throat, windpipe, and trachea"
987,Oral Cancer,What are the stages of oral cancer?,"There are four stages of oral cancer. Stage 1:The tumor is 2 centimeters (cm) or smaller, and the cancer hasn’t spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 2:The tumor is between 2-4 cm, and cancer cells haven’t spread to the lymph nodes. Stage 3:The tumor is either larger than 4 cm and hasn’t spread to the lymph nodes, or is any size and has spread to one lymph node, but not to other parts of the body. Stage 4:Tumors are any size and the cancer cells have spread to nearby tissues, the lymph nodes, or other parts of the body. According to theNational Cancer Institute, the five-year survival rates for oral cavity and pharynx cancers are as follows: 83 percent,for localized cancer (that hasn’t spread) 64 percent,for cancer that’s spread to nearby lymph nodes 38 percent,for cancer that’s spread to other parts of the body Overall,60 percentof all people with oral cancer will survive for five years or more. The earlier the stage at diagnosis, the higher the chance of survival after treatment. In fact, the five-year overall survival rate in those with stage 1 and 2 oral cancers is typically70 to 90 percent. This makes timely diagnosis and treatment all the more important."
988,Oral Cancer,How is oral cancer treated?,"Treatment for oral cancer will vary depending on the type, location, and stage of the cancer at diagnosis. Treatment for early stages usually involves surgery to remove the tumor and cancerous lymph nodes. In addition, other tissue around the mouth and neck may be taken out. Radiation therapyis another option. This involves a doctor aiming radiation beams at the tumor once or twice a day, five days a week, for two to eight weeks. Treatment for advanced stages will usually involve a combination of chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Chemotherapyis a treatment with drugs that kill cancer cells. The medicine is given to you either orally or through an intravenous (IV) line. Most people get chemotherapy on an outpatient basis, although some require hospitalization. Targeted therapy is another form of treatment. It can be effective in both early and advanced stages of cancer. Targeted therapy drugs will bind to specific proteins on cancer cells and interfere with their growth. Nutrition is also an important part of your oral cancer treatment. Many treatments make it difficult or painful to eat and swallow, and poor appetite and weight loss are common. Make sure you discuss your diet with your doctor. Getting the advice of a nutritionist can help you plan a food menu that will be gentle on your mouth and throat, and will provide your body with the calories, vitamins, and minerals it needs to heal. Finally, keeping yourmouth healthyduring cancer treatments is a crucial part of treatment. Make sure to keep your mouth moist and your teeth and gums clean."
989,Oral Cancer,Recovering from oral cancer treatment,"The recovery from each type of treatment will vary. Postsurgery symptoms can include pain and swelling, but removing small tumors usually has no associated long-term problems. The removal of larger tumors could possibly affect your ability to chew, swallow, or talk as well as you did before the surgery. You might also need reconstructive surgery to rebuild the bones and tissues in your face removed during surgery. Radiation therapy can have a negative effect on the body. Some of the side effects of radiation include: a sore throat or mouth dry mouth and loss of salivary gland function tooth decay nausea and vomiting sore or bleeding gums skin and mouth infections jaw stiffness and pain problems wearing dentures fatigue a change in your ability to taste and smell changes in your skin, including dryness and burning weight loss thyroid changes Chemotherapy drugs can be toxic to rapidly growing noncancerous cells. This can causeside effectssuch as: hair loss painful mouth and gums bleeding in the mouth severe anemia weakness poor appetite nausea vomiting diarrhea mouth and lip sores numbness in the hands and feet Recovering from targeted therapies is usually minimal. The side effects of this treatment can include: fever headache vomiting diarrhea an allergic reaction skin rashes Although these treatments do have side effects, they’re often necessary in beating the cancer. Your doctor will discuss the side effects and help you weigh the pros and cons of your treatment options."
990,Oral Cancer,Reconstruction and rehabilitation after oral cancer treatment,People who are diagnosed with advanced oral cancer will likely need reconstructive surgery and some rehabilitation to assist with eating and speaking during recovery. Reconstruction can involve dental implants or grafts to repair the missing bones and tissues in the mouth or face. Artificial palates are used to replace any missing tissue or teeth. Rehabilitation is also necessary for cases of advanced cancer. Speech therapy can be provided from the time you get out of surgery until you reach the maximum level of improvement.
991,Oral Cancer,Outlook,"The outlook for oral cancers depends on the specific type and stage of cancer at diagnosis. It also depends on your general health, your age, and your tolerance and response to treatment. Early diagnosis is critical because treating stage 1 and stage 2 cancers may be less involved and have a higher chance of successful treatment. After treatment, your doctor will want you to get frequent checkups to make sure that you’re recovering. Your checkups will usually consist of physical exams, blood tests, X-rays, and CT scans. Make sure to follow up with your dentist or oncologist if you notice anything out of the ordinary."
992,Osteoarthritis,Overview,"Osteoarthritis is the most common type of arthritis, affecting nearly 32.5 million people in the United States. It can cause joint pain, stiffness, loss of flexibility, reduced range of motion, tenderness when pressing affected areas, joint inflammation, and crepitus (grating/crackling sounds). While there’s no cure for osteoarthritis, treatment options include lifestyle measures like exercise and weight management, medications (both OTC and prescription), physical therapy, and in severe cases, surgery. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative joint condition thatcausesinflammation, stiffness, and pain in the joints. It’s the most common type of arthritis, affecting nearly32.5 millionpeople in the United States. Over time, osteoarthritis may reduce mobility and impact your quality of life, but treatments could help slow the progression of the disease. Keep reading to learn more about the symptoms, types, causes, and treatments for osteoarthritis."
993,Osteoarthritis,Osteoarthritis symptoms,"Symptoms of osteoarthritis may vary depending on the severity of your condition and which part of your body is affected. The most common symptoms of osteoarthritis mayinclude: joint pain stiffness in the joint loss of flexibility reduced range of motion tenderness or discomfort when pressing on the affected areas with your fingers joint inflammation crepitus, or grating, crackling, clicking, or popping sounds when moving your joints bone spurs, or extra lumps of bone, which are typically painless As osteoarthritis becomes more advanced, the pain associated with it may become more intense. Over time,swelling in the jointand surrounding area may also occur. Learn more about thesymptoms of osteoarthritis."
994,Osteoarthritis,Osteoarthritis causes,"Osteoarthritis is caused by gradualjoint and cartilage damage. Cartilageis a tough, rubbery substance that protects the ends of bones within a joint, allowing them to move easily against each other. With osteoarthritis, this cartilage breaks down over time, leading to bones rubbing against each other. This may cause intense pain and other osteoarthritis symptoms. Researchers don’t yet know the underlying cause of this gradual joint degeneration, according to theNational Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases. However,several osteoarthritis risk factorshave been identified, which may contribute to the development and progression of the condition. These mayinclude: genetics, such as having a family member with the condition past injuries, such as torn cartilage, dislocated joints, or ligament injuries being age 50 years and older being assigned female at birth having overweight orobesity having gone throughmenopause having anoccupationthat involves kneeling, climbing, heavy lifting, or similar actions having another medical condition that affects your joint health, such as adifferent type of arthritis Learn more about thepossible causes of osteoarthritis."
995,Osteoarthritis,Types of osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis may affect different parts of your body. It most commonly affects thekneesandhips, but it may occur in any joint. Other types of osteoarthritisinclude: hands osteoarthritis fingers osteoarthritis shoulder osteoarthritis spinal osteoarthritis cervical osteoarthritis (spondylosis) Osteoarthritis is a progressive condition, which means symptoms may spread to other parts of your body. Having osteoarthritis in one part of your body may also increase your risk of developing the condition in other body parts, according to theArthritis Foundation."
996,Osteoarthritis,Stages of osteoarthritis,"Osteoarithis is a progressive condition that may be classified intofour stages. This may depend on the severity of your symptoms and the degree of joint and cartilage damage. Thefour stagesof osteoarthritis are: Stage 1 (Mild): You may experienceearly symptoms of osteoarthritis, but your cartilage is still in good shape. Stage 2 (Moderate): You may experience sharp, acute symptoms. Your cartilage is showing signs of wear and tear. Stage 3 (Advanced): You may experience constant osteoarthritis symptoms, especially when you apply weight to the affected joint. The joint cartilage is also almost completely gone. Stage 4 (Severe): This is themost severe formof osteoarthritis. You may experience:severe pain, stiffness, and inflammationdecreased range of motionjoint instability, such as suddenlockingorbucklingother symptoms, such asmuscle weakness, bone spurs, and joint deformity severe pain, stiffness, and inflammation decreased range of motion joint instability, such as suddenlockingorbuckling other symptoms, such asmuscle weakness, bone spurs, and joint deformity During stage 4 osteoarthritis, you’ll likely need surgery to reduce your symptoms and increase mobility, function, and quality of life. Learn more about thefour stages of osteoarthritis."
997,Osteoarthritis,Osteoarthritis diagnosis,"Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition that usually develops gradually. It may be hard to provide an accurate diagnosis in the early stages. A healthcare professionalwill startwith a physical examination and ask about your symptoms and medical history. They may then order imaging tests to get a better look at your joints, such asX-rayorMRI. In some cases, a doctormay orderanESR blood testor asynovial (joint) fluid analysisto see if other conditions may be causing inflammation or joint pain. Some conditions they may rule outinclude: rheumatoid arthritis psoriatic arthritis gout pseudogout hemochromatosis bursitis If you need help finding a primary care doctor, check out ourHealthline FindCare tool."
998,Osteoarthritis,Osteoarthritis treatment,"There’s no cure for osteoarthritis, but treatment willaim to help: relieve symptoms increase joint flexibility, mobility, and function reduce inflammation increase your quality of life A healthcare professional can help develop the best treatment plan for you. This may vary for every individual depending on several factors, such as the severity of your symptoms and which part of your body is affected. Your osteoarthritis treatment plan will typically include a combination of treatments. These may include: lifestyle changes, such asexercise,sleep, and weight management dietary changes, such as eating anti-inflammatory foods natural remedies, such asyoga,supplements, and cold and heat therapies over-the-counter (OTC) medications, such asnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) prescription medications, such as corticosteroids physical therapy assistive devices, such asknee braces surgery, such astotal knee replacementandosteotomy Learn more about the differenttreatments for osteoarthritis."
999,Osteoarthritis,Complications of osteoarthritis,"Osteoarthritis may lead to a variety of physical, mental, and emotional complications if left untreated. A common complication of osteoarthritis is increased stiffness in your joints, which could lead to impaired balance and mobility. According to theArthritis Foundation, this may significantly increase your risk of falling, which could lead to minor or severe injuries. Other possible complications of osteoarthritis may include: poor sleep weight gain as a result of pain or limited mobility anxiety depression osteonecrosis, or bone death erosion of theligaments and tendons hairline (stress) fractures hemarthrosis, or bleeding near the joints Learn more about thecomplications of osteoarthritis."
1000,Osteoarthritis,Osteoarthritis prevention,"You may have risk factors for osteoarthritis that you can’t change, such as heredity and age. However, there are several modifiable risk factors that could be prevented with the following tips: maintain ahealthy-for-you weight get at least150 minutesof low impact exercise each week manage your blood sugar levels, especially if you havediabetes manage your blood pressure, especially if you havehypertension eat awell-balanced, anti-inflammatory diet use proper techniques when lifting objects, such as lifting with your hips and legs instead of your back use assistive devices, such ascanes wearproper footwear Learn more abouthow to prevent osteoarthritis."
1001,Osteoarthritis,Osteoarthritis vs. rheumatoid arthritis,"Osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) share similar symptoms, but they’re two different conditions. Osteoarthritis is a degenerative condition, which means it increases in severity over time. RA mayalso causeprogressive joint damage over time if left untreated. However, RA is anautoimmune disorder. This means the immune system mistakenly attacks the healthy, soft lining (synovium) around your joints. As the immune system launches its assault, fluid buildup occurs within the joint. This causes stiffness, pain, swelling, and inflammation. If you’re unsure which form of arthritis you may have, speak with a doctor. They can provide a proper diagnosis and develop a treatment plan for your condition. Learn more about thedifferences between osteoarthritis and RA."
1002,Osteoarthritis,Frequently asked questions,"The best treatment for osteoarthritis will depend on the type and severity of your symptoms. Exercising, eating a well-balanced diet, and following your treatment plan could help improve symptoms, mobility, and quality of life. The best treatment for osteoarthritis will depend on several factors, such as the severity of your symptoms. For example, lifestyle changes and natural remedies may be enough to help manage stages 1 and 2 osteoarthritis. However, stages 3 and 4 osteoarthritis may require more invasive treatments, such as surgery. If you have osteoarthritis, it’s best to avoid high impact activities, twisting the affected joint, or putting excessive strain on the affected joint."
1003,Osteoarthritis,Takeaway,"Osteoarthritis is a chronic condition that may cause inflammation, pain, and stiffness in your joints. Although there’s no cure, a treatment plan could help manage your symptoms, increase mobility, and improve your quality of life. Speak with a healthcare professional if you think you may have osteoarthritis. They could provide a proper diagnosis and develop a treatment plan that’s right for you."
1004,Osteoporosis,Overview,"Osteoporosis is often called a silent disease because bone loss can occur without any symptoms until a fracture happens. While brittle nails, inadequate oral health, and weak grip strength can be signs of bone loss, they are not reliable indicators of osteoporosis. You can discuss your risk factors with a doctor, especially if you are older, smoke, or have a family history of fractures, to determine if screening or preventive measures are necessary. Like high blood pressure, osteoporosis is a silent disease. This means you will likely not notice any major changes in your health at first. With osteoporosis, this often means a fracture or broken bone due to loss in bone density. Your best chance at early detection is to know your risk factors and discuss screenings with a doctor."
1005,Osteoporosis,Early signs and symptoms of osteoporosis,"Osteoporosisis knownas a “silent disease.” This is because it typically does not show early signs or symptoms. Often, you first discover you have the condition when you break a bone unexpectedly. Still, some signs may be present that suggest bone loss, including: Brittle or weak nails:Nail health may suggest possible weakening bone health. However, a2018 studynoted that while this assessment is promising, using fingernails to diagnose bone health is still not practical yet. Poor oral health:Older researchhas shown some connection between osteoporosis and periodontal disease. Both are associated with bone loss and share some similar risk factors, including lack of vitamin D and smoking. Minimal grip strength:A2020 studyexamining postmenopausal women found that weaker grip strength increased the risk of falls and was associated with lower mineral density in the bones. Since osteoporosis is unlikely to cause any obvious signs or symptoms, it’s best if you talk with a doctor if you have one or more risk factors, such as a family history of the disease."
1006,Osteoporosis,Late signs and symptoms of osteoporosis,"Signs of osteoporosistypically don’tbecome obvious until the condition is quite advanced. Here are some potential signs and symptoms of late-stage osteoporosis. If osteoporosis affects the bones in the spine, you may notice: hunched or stooped posture back pain reduced height malformations in the spine At this point, a doctor would be able to see changes in bone structure during a physical examination. Some people may spontaneously break a bone due to stress from various activities, such as coughing, stretching, or lifting heavy objects. In some cases, you may discover you have osteoporosis if you have a minor fall or trip that causes you to break a bone when most people would not."
1007,Osteoporosis,What are the complications of osteoporosis?,"Pathological fractures are themost serious and commoncomplication associated with osteoporosis. A pathological break means the break did not occur due to an outside force or stress. Pathological fractures of the hips or spine are often the most problematic. They can lead to disability. Severe fractures can also increase the risk of mortality or death. Structural changes in the back, such as developing a hunched posture, is another possible complication."
1008,Osteoporosis,What are the risk factors for osteoporosis?,"Common risk factors for osteoporosis include: advancing age bodyweight under 128 pounds smoking low levels of physical activity a personal history of a fracture from a ground-level fall or minor trauma after age 40 being of white or Asian race having experienced early menopause People assigned female at birth have a higher chance of developing primary osteoporosis. People assigned male at birth have a lower risk of primary osteoporosis but an increased risk of developing secondary osteoporosis from medication or other underlying causes. Certain other medical conditions can increase your risk of osteoporosis, including: hyperparathyroidism anorexia malabsorption of nutrients hyperthyroidism overtreatment of hypothyroidism chronic renal failure Cushing syndrome any disease that can lead to long-term immobilization vitamin D deficiency living with diabetes a history of breast cancer"
1009,Osteoporosis,The takeaway,"Osteoporosis does not typically cause any early signs or symptoms. Signs often only occur once the disease has advanced to a point where your bones break easily. Some of the most common symptoms involve spontaneous or stress-related breaks, such as from falls. Some people may also develop back pain and structural changes if it affects the spine. If you have one or more risk factors for osteoporosis, consider discussing your personal risks with a doctor. They may be able to start therapy or make recommendations for what you can do to slow its progression."
1010,Ovarian Cysts,Overview,"Ovarian cysts are very common. They’re usually a sign of ovulation and have no symptoms. In some cases, they can point to an underlying condition and may need to be removed. The ovaries are part of thefemale reproductive system. There are two ovaries, located in the lower abdomen on both sides of the uterus. The ovaries produce eggs and the hormones estrogen and progesterone. Ovarian cysts are fluid-filled sacs that can form on one or both ovaries. They are common, with at least20%of women developing at least one pelvic cyst in their lifetime. Most ovarian cysts are benign (noncancerous) and do not need to be removed. This article examines the different types of ovarian cysts, what causes them, when they need treatment, how they can be prevented, and more. You’ll notice the language used to share stats and other data points is prettybinary, fluctuating between the use of “male” and “female” or “men” and “women.” While we typically avoid language like this, specificity is key when reporting on research participants and clinical findings. We rely on publicly accessible research that isn’t behind a paywall. Unless otherwise noted, it’s unclear whether the studies and surveys referenced in this article included participants withexpansive gender identities."
1011,Ovarian Cysts,What are the types of ovarian cysts?,"There are various ovarian cysts, such as dermoid cysts and endometriomas (also called chocolate cysts). However, the most common type is fluid-filled cysts that form during themenstrual cycle. These are follicular cysts and corpus luteum cysts. During the menstrual cycle, an egg grows in a follicle sac. This sac is located inside the ovaries. In most cases, the follicle breaks open and releases an egg. If the follicle doesn’t break open, the fluid inside the follicle can form a cyst on the ovary. Thecorpus luteumis a benign structure that appears in an ovary after an egg is released. Its job is to release hormones needed for pregnancy. However, it will break down after a few days unless a pregnancy starts. In some cases, it may not dissolve. Instead, additional fluiddevelopsinside it, resulting in a cyst. Ovarian cysts that aren’t formed as part of a typical menstrual cycle include: Dermoid cysts: Thesesac-like growthson the ovaries can contain hair, fat, and other tissue. Endometriomas: Tissues that normally grow inside the uterus can develop outside the uterus and attach to the ovaries. These are also colloquially called chocolate cysts and may affect people with severeendometriosis. Cystadenomas: These growths can develop on the outer surface of the ovaries. Some people develop a condition calledpolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), in which the ovaries form many small cysts. PCOS can cause the ovaries to enlarge. If left untreated, polycystic ovaries can result in infertility."
1012,Ovarian Cysts,What does it feel like to have an ovarian cyst?,"Oftentimes, ovarian cysts don’t cause any symptoms. However, symptoms can appear if the cyst grows. Symptoms may include: abdominal bloating or swelling painful bowel movements pelvic pain before or during the menstrual cycle painful intercourse pain in the lower back or thighs breast tenderness nausea and vomiting Severe symptoms can indicate anovarian torsionor aruptured cyst. These include: severe or sharp pelvic pain fever faintness or dizziness rapid breathing Both complications are rare, but can have serious consequences if not treated early."
1013,Ovarian Cysts,Diagnosing an ovarian cyst,"A doctor may detect an ovarian cyst during a routinepelvic exam. They may notice swelling on one of your ovaries and order anultrasoundto confirm the presence of a cyst. An ultrasound is an imaging test that uses high-frequency sound waves to produce an image of your internal organs. Ultrasound tests help determine the size, location, shape, and composition (solid or fluid-filled) of a cyst. Other imaging tools that may be used to diagnose ovarian cysts include: CT scan: ACT scanuses a body imaging device to create cross-sectional images of internal organs. MRI:AnMRIuses magnetic fields to produce in-depth images of internal organs. Because most cysts disappear after a few weeks or months, the doctor may not immediately recommend a treatment plan. Instead, they may repeat the ultrasound test in a few weeks or months to check your condition. In certain cases, no further monitoring will be needed, especially if you previously had a follicular cyst or corpus luteum cyst. If your condition does not improve or the cyst increases in size, the doctor may request additional tests to determine other causes of your symptoms. These may include apregnancy testor hormone level tests. The hormone level test helps check for hormone-related issues, such as having too muchestrogenorprogesterone."
1014,Ovarian Cysts,Treatment options for an ovarian cyst,"Most ovarian cysts are benign and naturally go away on their own without treatment. These cysts cause little, if any, symptoms.Home remedieslike heat therapy can help ease any symptoms you do have. That said, if treatment is necessary, the kind of treatment will depend on the type of cyst. Some larger cysts, endometromas, or cancerous cysts usuallyneed to be removedsurgically. Options for surgery include: Laparoscopy: A doctor performs alaparoscopyby making several tiny incisions near your navel and inserting a small instrument into your abdomen to remove the cyst. Laparotomy: In this procedure, a doctor can surgically remove the cyst through a large incision in your abdomen. This is known as laparotomy. They can then do abiopsyif they are concerned about cancer."
1015,Ovarian Cysts,Potential complications of ovarian cysts,"In rare instances, a doctor may detect acancerous cystic ovarian massduring a routine examination. Ovarian torsion is another rare complication of ovarian cysts. It occurs when a large cyst causes an ovary to twist or move from its original position. Blood supply to the ovary is cut off. If not treated, ovarian torsion can cause damage or death to the ovarian tissue. Ruptured cysts rarely cause intense pain andinternal bleeding. This complication increases your risk of an infection and can be life threatening if left untreated."
1016,Ovarian Cysts,Preventing ovarian cysts,"If you have recurring ovarian cysts, a doctor can prescribeoral contraceptives to stop ovulation and prevent the development of new cysts. Oral contraceptives can also help reduce your risk of ovarian cancer. The risk of ovarian cancer is higher in postmenopausal females. In addition, in a study on rats,researchersfound that combiningsupplements of the antioxidant resveratroland the diabetes medicationmetforminmay help support healthy weight and hormone levels, as well as an optimized follicular cell structure within the ovaries. This may help prevent cyst formation. Routine gynecologic examinations can also help a doctor detect ovarian cysts early. Alert a doctor to symptoms that may indicate a problem, such as: changes to your menstrual cycle ongoing pelvic pain loss of appetite unexplained weight loss abdominal fullness Benign ovarian cystsrarely becomecancerous. However, symptoms ofovarian cancercan mimic symptoms of an ovarian cyst. For this reason, it’s important to visit a doctor and receive a diagnosis."
1017,Ovarian Cysts,Long-term outlook for people with ovarian cysts,"The outlook for premenopausal people with ovarian cysts is good. Most cysts disappear within a few months. However, premenopausal people and people with hormone imbalances such as PCOS can also experience recurring ovarian cysts. If left untreated, some cysts can decrease fertility. This depends on the type of cyst. Ovulatory cysts indicate regular menstrual cycles, but endometriomas suggest endometriosis, which can harm fertility. Dermoid cysts can cause pain and make sexual intercourse more painful, affecting conception. To improve fertility, a doctor can remove or shrink the cyst. However, laparoscopic removal of some types of cystscould also negatively impactyour fertility. A “wait and see” approach may be appropriate for ovarian cysts depending on cyst size and type. A doctor may recommend surgery to remove and examine any cyst or growth that develops on the ovariesafter menopause. This is because the chance of developing a cancerous cyst or ovarian cancer increases after menopause. However, it’s worth noting that ovarian cysts don’t increase the chance of getting ovarian cancer."
1018,Overactive Bladder,Overview,"Overactive bladder (OAB) is characterized by a frequent and urgent need to urinate, which may also include involuntary urine release and frequent urination, impacting quality of life due to its unpredictability. Diagnosis of OAB involves a combination of urine testing, physical exams, bladder scans, and other specialized tests to identify underlying causes such as UTIs or bladder abnormalities. Management of OAB includes pelvic floor therapy, medications like tolterodine and mirabegron, botox injections to relax bladder muscles, nerve stimulation, and, in severe cases, surgical options to increase bladder capacity. OAB causes a sudden urge to urinate. It can also trigger involuntary release of urine, known as incontinence. This condition affects millions of people worldwide. According to a 2025 research review, it may occur in20% of the global populationand affects more women than men. The symptoms can be difficult to manage because OAB may be unpredictable. As a result, if you have this condition, you may feel the need to limit your social activities. That lack of social interaction may affect your quality of life and can lead to isolation and emotional distress. But there are several treatments available that can help you manage your symptoms. Treating OAB can improve the outlook for the condition and reduce the frequency of incontinence."
1019,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder symptoms,"Experiencing occasionalincontinencedoesn’t mean you have OAB. Urine leakage can happen for other reasons. You might have some leakage when you laugh very hard, or you might experience incontinence if you’ve been fighting the urge to urinate for a long time. The frequency and urgency of urination determine an OAB diagnosis. Symptoms include: an urgent and uncontrollable need to urinate frequent involuntary release of urine frequent urination(more than 8 times in 24 hours) a pattern of waking up more than once per night to use the bathroom Symptoms of OAB can change and might vary from person to person, so the condition can be difficult to identify without a doctor’s help. Knowing the symptoms of OAB can help you find better treatments faster."
1020,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder treatment,"Several treatments are available to help you manage symptoms of OAB. Some physical therapists focus specifically on the pelvic muscles. Throughtargeted muscle exercisesand strengthening, a pelvic floor physical therapist can help you manage a variety of urinary problems, including urgency, frequency, and nighttime symptoms. Medications that treat OAB have two primary effects: relieving symptoms and reducing episodes of urge and incontinence. These medications include: tolterodine (Detrol, Detrol LA) trospium (Sanctura) mirabegron (Myrbetriq) OAB medications may cause someside effects, including dry eyes, dry mouth, and constipation. Small doses ofBotoxcan temporarily paralyze or weaken your bladder muscles. This treatment can cause the muscles to contract less often, reducing symptoms of OAB. The effects of an injection typically last6 to 9 months, so you may need repeated injections. This procedure changes the electrical signal of the nerves that carry impulses to your bladder. Healthcare professionals can perform theelectrical stimulationusing a small needle inserted through the skin of your lower leg. Although many studies on this treatment have been small,some researchhas suggested that itcan reducefrequency and urgency in people with OAB. If medication, nerve stimulation, or other therapies don’t help reduce your symptoms, your doctor might suggest surgery to increase your bladder’s capacity."
1021,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder causes,"Your kidneys make urine, which travels to your bladder. Typically, your brain sends signals that tell your body to urinate, and then your pelvic floor muscles relax and allow urine to exit your body. But when you have OAB, your bladder muscles contract involuntarily. This causes you to feel like you need to urinate frequently, even if your bladder isn’t full. Factors and conditions that can cause OAB symptoms include: excessive fluid intake medications that increase urine production urinary tract infections (UTIs) consumption of caffeine, alcohol, or other bladder irritants incomplete emptying of your bladder when urinating bladder health conditions, such asbladder stones The exact cause of OAB is unknown. The risk of developing the conditionincreaseswith age. But OAB is not a typical part of aging, so it’s important not to ignore the symptoms if you experience them. Make an appointment with a doctor so you can get a diagnosis. Bladder function relies on good urinary tract health. Thecauses of OABare often due to issues in your urinary tract."
1022,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder diagnosis,"A doctor may use several tests to diagnose the cause of your OAB symptoms. They might also refer you to a urologist (a specialist who treats urinary tract conditions). Tests used to diagnose OAB include: Urine testing (urinalysis):Healthcare professionals will test a sample of your urine for any abnormalities, includingblood. Aurinalysiscan help identify a UTI or another urinary tract problem. Physical examination:Your doctor might feel for tenderness around your abdomen and kidneys or check for anenlarged prostate. Bladder scan:This test involves using ultrasound to measure the amount of urine left in your bladder after you urinate. Urodynamic testing:This assortment of tests can assess your bladder’s ability to hold and store urine. Cystoscopy:During this test, a doctor inserts a lighted scope into your bladder while you’re sedated. Acystoscopyhelps your doctor identify whether your symptoms are due to any abnormalities within your bladder, such as bladder stones or tumors. A doctor might also takebiopsiesduring this procedure. Your doctor or urologist may use additional tests to help rule out or confirm an OAB diagnosis."
1023,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder in men,"OAB is more common in women but also occurs in men. Studies suggest that up to27% of menmay have OAB, but that number could be higher because some menmay not tella doctor about their symptoms. Additionally, doctorsmight misdiagnoseOAB in men, attributing the symptoms to other conditions. Symptoms of OAB in men include: frequently feeling an urgent need to urinate urinating up to eight times per day experiencing urine leakage not being able to control your urination Many cases of OAB in men are the result of anenlarged prostate, which can block urine flow and make urinary incontinence more common. An enlarged prostate becomesmore commonwith age, particularly among those ages 60 years and older, so OAB is also more common in older people. In these cases, treating the prostate condition may ease symptoms of OAB."
1024,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder in women,"Women aremore likelythan men to report symptoms of OAB to a doctor. Studies suggest that up to43% of womenmay experience OAB symptoms. However, the number may be higher since some peoplemay not reporttheir symptoms to a doctor at all. OAB involves symptoms that cause you to need to urinate more frequently, including: feeling a sudden urge to urinate not being able to control your urination urinating at least two times every night urinating at least eight times every day It’s not clear what causes OAB, but the symptomsbecomemore common aftermenopause, possibly as a result of decreased estrogen levels. However, OAB can occur at any age. Treatment for OAB can include medication, surgery, physical exercises, and some other methods."
1025,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder in children,"OAB is a common childhood condition, but not every instance of bedwetting is the result of OAB. While children often grow out of OAB symptoms, treatment can help prevent frequent urination or complications. Symptoms of OAB in children include: having an urgent or frequent need to urinate experiencing accidents or urine leaks urinating more than eight times in a day feeling as if they have not emptied their bladder completely when urinating Symptoms of OAB becomeless commonas children get older. With age, kids learn to control their bladder and recognize signals that they need to urinate. If symptoms of OAB don’t seem to be resolving or are getting worse, talk with your child’s doctor. Causes of OAB in children include: UTIs allergies caffeine anxietyand stress structural differences in the body constipation Like those for adults, treatments for OAB in children focus on treating any underlying causes and preventing symptoms."
1026,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder surgery,"In most cases, a doctor will not recommend surgery unless you’ve tried all the other treatment options without finding relief. OAB is often the result of errant nerve impulses that tell your bladder you need to urinate when you don’t. These impulses may cause frequent urination or urges even when you’ve already urinated. During a sacral nerve stimulation procedure, a doctor can place a small electrode under the skin of your buttocks or lower abdomen. This electrode will send pulses that help regulate the nerve signals that tell your body when you need to urinate. Rerouting your ureters (the tubes that carry urine from your kidneys to your bladder) can reduce the frequency and urge to urinate. During this procedure, your doctor will bypass your bladder and create an opening in your abdominal wall where urine can empty into an ostomy bag. If your doctor thinks your OAB symptoms are occurring because your bladder is small, they may suggest this procedure to enlarge it. However, cystoplasty is typically reserved for people who have seen no improvements from other treatment options. In rare cases, your doctor may decide thatremoving your bladderis the only option to eliminate OAB symptoms and complications. When they do this, they will reroute urine from your kidneys to an ostomy bag outside your body. This type of surgery is often highly effective, but it comes with risks and possible long-term complications."
1027,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder diet,"What you eat may directly affect your urinary health. Some types of foods and drinks can place stress on your bladder, increasing your risk of bladder irritation and OAB symptoms. However, a food that affects you may not affect someone else. Keeping a food log can help you figure out which foods might make your symptoms worse. Diet-related factors that can interfere with urinary health include: Carbonated drinks:Bubbly drinks can worsen OAB symptoms and irritate the muscles in your bladder. Excessive fluid intake:Drinking enough water is important for your overall health, but if you drink too much water, you’ll need to urinate more often. Fluid intake before bed:If you drink anything within 2 to 3 hours before bed, you might find that you wake up to urinate more often during the night. Gluten sensitivity:People who have an allergy or sensitivity to gluten (a protein found in wheat-based foods like bread, pasta, and crackers) may experience more symptoms of OAB. Caffeine:This stimulant may increase OAB symptoms.Caffeineis found in some types of soda, coffee, chocolate, ice cream, and some over-the-counter medications. Irritating foods:Some people find thatcertain foodsor ingredients increase their OAB symptoms. Examples include citrus fruits, tomato products, spicy foods, artificial sweeteners, alcoholic beverages, artificial flavorings, and preservatives. As you figure out the best diet to reduce your OAB symptoms, your doctor might also suggest taking certain nutritional supplements to fill any nutrient gaps in your diet."
1028,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder natural treatment,"In addition to any necessary medical treatment, some complementary treatments may help reduce OAB symptoms. You might consider using some herbs, vitamins, and othersupplementsas alternative treatments for OAB. Examplesinclude: Chinese herbal blends such as gosha-junki-gan mushroom extracts such as Ganoderma lucidum plant extracts such as corn silk and capsaicin A2025 studyfound that low magnesium levels may be associated with OAB, and some small,older studieshavesuggestedthat taking magnesium supplements may help reduce urinary symptoms. But more research is needed. Smallstudieshave also suggested that L-arginine supplementationmay help reducesymptoms in people with certain urinary conditions, including men with lower urinary tract symptoms and women with interstitial cystitis. However, more studies are necessary to find out whether these supplements may be helpful for OAB. Limited researchsuggeststhat increasing your intake of certain nutrients, such as vitamin D and calcium, may help reduce OAB symptoms. But before you take any of these supplements, check with your doctor to make sure they’re safe for you. Some supplements can interfere with prescription medications. Acupuncture involves inserting fine-tipped needles into your skin in specific areas of your body. Activating these points is thought to restore the flow of energy, which may ease symptoms. According to a2018 research review, acupuncture might help relieve OAB symptoms, but there’s not yet enough evidence to know whether it works. OAB is often the result of nerves firing and causing muscles to contract unexpectedly.Essential oilsthat can help calm these nerves and muscles may help you find symptom relief. According to a2024 research review, essential oils from plants such as ylang-ylang, Cucurbita pepo (pumpkin), and Vanilla planifolia may help reduce some urinary symptoms. A2013 studyalso suggests that the scent of clary sage essential oil may help reduce stress during urinary exams in people who experience incontinence. This type of treatment relies on listening to your body and finding treatments that can address your whole body, not just your OAB symptoms. Cutting out foods that may irritate your bladder and cause urgency is one example of a homeopathic remedy. Bladder trainingand muscle training can also be considered homeopathic. These methods can help you increase the length of time you can go between feeling an urge to urinate and actually urinating."
1029,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder exercises,"The muscles around your urinary tract help you hold urine when you have an urge. They also help you fully empty your bladder when you urinate. Strengthening these muscles through exercise can be beneficial for managing OAB. These exercises, also known asKegels, can help you strengthen the muscles in and around your pelvis. The increased strength can help you stop and start urination more effectively so that you can potentially reduce unintentional urination. A basic Kegel requires you to squeeze the muscles in your pelvic floor and hold for several seconds. If you’re unsure which muscles to isolate, imagine trying to stop the flow of urine. You can do this several times each day. If you’d like to learn more about how to strengthen your pelvic floor, you can ask your doctor for a referral to a pelvic floor physical therapist. If you find it too abstract or difficult to imagine using your pelvic floor muscles, using a device called avaginal conecan help you isolate those muscles. You place a cone inside your vagina and attempt to hold it in place with your pelvic floor muscles. You can do this at least once per day. As your muscles become stronger, you’ll be able to use heavier cones. Bladder traininghelps you hold your urine longer so you can reteach the muscles and nerves in your urinary tract. In other words, this strategy helps you lengthen the time between when you feel an urge to urinate and when you actually urinate. You can try this each time you need to urinate. Start with a short period, such as 3 minutes, and slowly build up."
1030,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder at night,"If you find that you wake up to urinate more than one time per night, you might havenocturia, or overactive bladder at night. Nocturia is not the same as OAB. In fact, some people who don’t experience any OAB symptoms during the day still have nocturia. Nocturia is more common in people60 years old and older, but1 in 3 adultsover 30 make two or more trips to the bathroom each night. Most adults can sleep for 6 to 8 hours without waking up, while others may need to wake up only once. If you’ve been waking up often to use the bathroom at night, you might be experiencing nocturia. Consider talking with a doctor about it."
1031,Overactive Bladder,Overactive bladder and Botox,"Botox may be best known as a facial wrinkle reducer, but Botox injections have also shown great promise as a treatment for many medical conditions. Most OAB medications aim to calm the muscles and nerves in your urinary tract. If these medications aren’t effective, your doctor might consider injectingBotoxinto your bladder muscles. This treatment can help calm the muscles and reduce OAB symptoms. Botox injections for OAB are generally well tolerated with few side effects. The injection’s effects typically last6 to 9 months. After that, your doctor might recommend another round of injections to manage your OAB symptoms. Botox injections do have some possible complications. You can talk with your doctor about any concerns you have and whether Botox for OAB may be an option for you."
1032,Overactive Bladder,The takeaway,"Overactive bladder (OAB) can present challenges in everyday life, but doctor-prescribed treatments and lifestyle strategies can help you reduce the frequency of urges. If you have symptoms of OAB or difficulty controlling your bladder, the most important thing you can do is talk with a doctor. OAB is often underreported. Research has come a long way in helping doctors understand the potential causes and treatments for OAB. You and your doctor can work together to develop a treatment plan and address any concerns you may have."
1033,Parasites,Overview,"A parasitic infection can cause various symptoms, depending on the organism. These can include flu-like or gastrointestinal symptoms, among others. Treatment may include medications. Parasites are organisms that live off other organisms, or hosts, to survive. Some parasites don’t noticeably affect their hosts. Others grow, reproduce, or invade organ systems that make their hosts sick, resulting in a parasitic infection. Parasitic infections are a big problem in tropical and subtropical regions of the world.Malariais one of the deadliest parasitic diseases. Parasitic infections can also occur in the United States. Common parasitic infections found in the United States include: trichomoniasis giardiasis cryptosporidiosis toxoplasmosis"
1034,Parasites,What are the symptoms of parasitic infections?,"The symptoms of parasitic infections vary depending on the organism. For example: Trichomoniasis is a sexually transmitted infection caused by a parasite that often produces no symptoms. In some cases, it may cause itching, redness, irritation, and an unusual discharge in your genital area. Giardiasis may cause diarrhea, gas, upset stomach, greasy stools, and dehydration. Cryptosporidiosis may cause stomach cramps, stomach pain, nausea, vomiting, dehydration, weight loss, and fever. Toxoplasmosis may cause flu-like symptoms, including swollen lymph nodes and muscle aches or pains that can last for over a month."
1035,Parasites,What causes parasitic infections?,"Parasitic infections can be caused by three types of organisms: protozoa helminths ectoparasites Protozoa are single-celled organisms that can live and multiply inside your body. Some infections caused by protozoa include giardiasis. This is a serious infection that you can contract from drinking water infected withGiardiaprotozoa. Helminths are multi-celled organisms that can live in or outside of your body. They’re more commonly known as worms. They include flatworms, tapeworms, thorny-headed worms,and roundworms. Ectoparasites are multicelled organisms that live on or feed off your skin. They include some insects and arachnids, such as mosquitos, fleas, ticks, and mites. Parasitic infections can be spread in a number of ways. For example, protozoa and helminths can be spread through contaminated water, food, waste, soil, and blood. Some can be passed through sexual contact. Some parasites are spread by insects that act as a vector, or carrier, of the disease. For example, malaria is caused by parasitic protozoa that are transmitted by mosquitos when they feed on humans."
1036,Parasites,Who is at risk of parasitic infections?,"Anyone can get a parasitic infection. But some people are at greater risk than others. You’re more likely to contract a parasitic infection if you: have a compromised immune system or are already sick with another illness live or travel in tropical or subtropical regions of the world lack a clean supply of drinking water swim in lakes, rivers, or ponds whereGiardiaor other parasites are common work in childcare, work with soil regularly, or work in other contexts where you come into contact with feces on a consistent basis Outdoor cats can come into contact with infected rodents and birds. This makes their owners more likely to contract toxoplasmosis, a type of protozoa. Toxoplasmosis can be very harmful for pregnant women and their developing babies. The infection is spread through cat feces. If you’re pregnant, it’s important to have someone else clean the litter box daily."
1037,Parasites,How are parasitic infections diagnosed?,"Parasitic infections can be diagnosed in a number of ways. For example, your doctor might perform or order: A blood test A fecal exam: In such an exam, a sample of your stool will be collected and checked for parasites and their eggs. An endoscopy or colonoscopy: These tests may be ordered if the results of a stool exam are inconclusive. While you are sedated, your doctor will pass a thin flexible tube through your mouth or rectum and into your digestive system to examine your intestinal tract. X-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), or computerized axial tomography (CAT): These scans are used to check for signs of lesions or injury to your organs caused by parasites. Your doctor may also order tests to check for bacteria or other things that can cause infections."
1038,Parasites,How are parasitic infections treated?,"Your treatment plan will depend on your specific diagnosis. Typically, your doctor will prescribe medications. For example, they may prescribe medications to treat trichomoniasis, giardiasis, or cryptosporidiosis. They probably won’t prescribe medications for toxoplasmosis if you’re not pregnant and otherwise healthy, unless you have a severe and prolonged infection. Your doctor may also recommend other treatments to relieve your symptoms. For example, many parasitic infections can cause diarrhea, which often leads to dehydration. Your doctor will likely encourage you to drink plenty of fluids to replenish those you lose."
1039,Parasites,How can parasitic infections be prevented?,"There are several steps you can take to lower your risk of contracting a parasitic infection: Practice safe sex, using a condom. Wash your hands regularly, especially after handling uncooked food or feces. Cook food to its recommended internal temperature. Drink clean water, including bottled water when you’re traveling. Avoid swallowing water from lakes, streams, or ponds. Avoid cat litter and feces when you’re pregnant. If you suspect you have a parasitic infection, make an appointment with your doctor. They can help diagnose the cause of your symptoms and recommend a treatment plan. By getting early treatment, you can help stop the spread of infection to other people."
1040,Parkinson's Disease,Overview,"Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological condition that affects movement due to a decrease in dopamine production in the brain. Early symptoms of Parkinson’s can include a reduced sense of smell, constipation, changes in handwriting and voice, and stooped posture, which can appear years before motor issues. Treatment options include lifestyle adjustments, medication to manage symptoms, and, in some cases, surgical interventions like deep brain stimulation. Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disorder. The first signs are problems with movement. Smooth and coordinated bodily muscle movements are made possible by dopamine, a substance in the brain. Dopamine is produced in a part of the brain called the “substantia nigra.” In Parkinson’s, the cells of the substantia nigra start to die. When this happens, dopamine levels are reduced. When they have dropped 60 to 80 percent, symptoms of Parkinson’s start to appear."
1041,Parkinson's Disease,Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease,"Some of the earlysymptomsof Parkinson’s can begin several years before motor problems develop. These earliest signs include: decreased ability to smell (anosmia) constipation small, cramped handwriting voice changes stooped posture The four major motor problems seen are: tremor (shaking that occurs at rest) slow movements stiffnessof arms, legs, and trunk problems with balanceand tendency to fall Secondary symptoms include: blank facial expression a tendency to get stuck when walking muffled, low-volume speech decreased blinking and swallowing tendency to fall backward reduced arm swinging when walking Parkinsonian gait, which is the tendency to take shuffling steps while walking Other associated symptoms may include: flaky white or yellow scales on oily parts of the skin, known asseborrheic dermatitis increased risk ofmelanoma, a serious type of skin cancer sleep disturbances including vivid dreams, talking, and movement during sleep depression anxiety hallucinations psychosis problems with attention andmemory difficulty with visual-spatial relationships Early signs of Parkinson’s disease may go unrecognized. Your body may try to alert you to the movement disorder many years before movement difficulties begin with these warning signs."
1042,Parkinson's Disease,Causes of Parkinson’s disease,"The exact cause of Parkinson’s is unknown. It may have both genetic and environmental components. Some scientists believe that viruses can trigger Parkinson’s as well. Low levels of dopamine and norepinephrine, a substance that regulates dopamine, have been linked with Parkinson’s. Abnormal proteins called Lewy bodies have also been found in the brains of people with Parkinson’s. Scientists do not know what role, if any, Lewy bodies play in the development of Parkinson’s. While there’s no known cause, research has identified groups of people who are more likely to develop the condition, which include: Sex.Men areone and a half timesmore likely to develop Parkinson’s than women. Race.According toresearch, there’s a higher prevalence of Parkinson’s in white people compared with Black or Asian people. Geographic location may be one reason for a higher risk. Age.Parkinson’s usually appears between ages 50 and 60 years. It only occurs before 40 years old in aboutfour percentof cases. Family history.People who have close family members with Parkinson’s disease are more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease. Toxins.Exposure to certain toxins may increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease. Head injury.People who experience head injuries may be more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease. Each year, researchers are trying to understand why people develop Parkinson’s.Learn more about what’s been discovered and what’s known about Parkinson’s risk factors."
1043,Parkinson's Disease,Treatments for Parkinson’s disease,"Treatment for Parkinson’s relies on a combination of: lifestyle changes medications therapies Adequate rest, exercise, and abalanced dietare important. Speech therapy, occupational therapy, and physical therapy can also help improve communication and self-care. In almost all cases, medication will be required to help manage the various physical and mental health symptoms associated with the disease. A number of different drugs can be used to treat Parkinson’s. Levodopa is the most common treatment for Parkinson’s. It helps to replenish dopamine. About 75 percent of cases respond to levodopa, but not all symptoms are improved. Levodopa is generally given with carbidopa. Carbidopa delays the breakdown of levodopa which in turn increases the availability of levodopa at the blood-brain barrier. Dopamine agonists can imitate the action of dopamine in the brain. They’re less effective than levodopa, but they can be useful as bridge medications when levodopa is less effective. Drugs in this class include bromocriptine, pramipexole, and ropinirole. Anticholinergics are used to block the parasympathetic nervous system. They can help with rigidity. Benztropine (Cogentin) and trihexyphenidyl are anticholinergics used to treat Parkinson’s. Amantadine (Symmetrel) can be used along with carbidopa-levodopa. It’s a glutamate-blocking drug (NMDA). It offers short-term relief for the involuntary movements (dyskinesia) that can be a side effect of levodopa. Catechol O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors prolong the effect of levodopa. Entacapone (Comtan) and tolcapone (Tasmar) are examples of COMT inhibitors. Tolcapone can cause liver damage. It’s usually saved for people who do not respond to other therapies. Ectacapone does not cause liver damage. Stalevo is a drug that combines ectacapone and carbidopa-levodopa in one pill. MAO-B inhibitors inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase B. This enzyme breaks down dopamine in the brain. Selegiline (Eldepryl) and rasagiline (Azilect) are examples of MAO-B inhibitors. Talk with your doctor before taking any other medications with MAO-B inhibitors. They can interact with many drugs, including: antidepressants ciprofloxacin St. John’s wort some narcotics Over time, the effectiveness of Parkinson’s medications can decrease. By late-stage Parkinson’s,the side effectsof some medications may outweigh the benefits. However, they may still provide adequate management of symptoms."
1044,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s surgery,"Surgical interventions are reserved for people who do not respond to medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes. Two primary types of surgery are used to treat Parkinson’s: Duringdeep brain stimulation (DBS), surgeons implant electrodes in specific parts of the brain. A generator connected to the electrodes sends out pulses to help reduce symptoms. In January 2015, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a pump-delivered therapy calledDuopa. The pump delivers a combination of levodopa and carbidopa. In order to use the pump, your doctor will have to perform a surgical procedure to place the pump near the small intestine."
1045,Parkinson's Disease,Diagnosing Parkinson’s disease,"There’s no specific test for diagnosing Parkinson’s. Diagnosis is made based on health history, a physical and neurological exam, as well as a review of signs and symptoms. Imaging tests, such as aCAT scanorMRI, may be used to rule out other conditions. Adopamine transporter (DAT)scan may also be used. While these tests do not confirm Parkinson’s, they can help rule out other conditions and support the doctor’s diagnosis."
1046,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s disease stages,"Parkinson’s is a progressive disease, which means symptoms of the condition typically worsen over time. Many doctors use the Hoehn and Yahr scale to classify its stages. This scale divides symptoms intofive stages, and it helps healthcare professionals learn how advanced disease signs and symptoms are. Stage 1 Parkinson’s is the mildest form. It’s so mild, in fact, you may not experience symptoms that are noticeable. They may not yet interfere with your daily life and tasks. If you do have symptoms, they may be isolated to one side of your body. The progression from stage 1 to stage 2 can take months or even years. Each person’s experience will be different. At this moderate stage, you may experience symptoms such as: muscle stiffness tremors changes in facial expressions trembling Muscle stiffness can complicate daily tasks, prolonging how long it takes you to complete them. However, at this stage, you’re unlikely to experience balance problems. Symptoms may appear on both sides of the body. Changes in posture,gait, and facial expressions may be more noticeable. At this middle stage, symptoms reach a turning point. While you’re unlikely to experience new symptoms, they may be more noticeable. They may also interfere with all of your daily tasks. Movements are noticeably slower, which slows down activities. Balance issues become more significant, too, so falls are more common. But people with stage 3 Parkinson’s can usually maintain their independence and complete activities without much assistance. The progression from stage 3 to stage 4 brings about significant changes. At this point, you will experience great difficulty standing without a walker or assistive device. Reactions and muscle movements also slow significantly. Living alone can be unsafe, possibly dangerous. In this most advanced stage, severe symptoms make around-the-clock assistance a necessity. It will be difficult to stand, if not impossible. A wheelchair will likely be required. Also, at this stage, individuals with Parkinson’s may experience confusion, delusions, andhallucinations. Thesecomplicationsof the disease can begin in the later stages."
1047,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s dementia,"Parkinson’s dementia is a complication of Parkinson’s disease. It causes people to develop difficulties with reasoning, thinking, and problem solving. It’s quite common —50 to 80 percentof people with Parkinson’s will experience some degree of dementia. Symptoms of Parkinson’s disease dementia include: depression sleep disturbances delusions confusion hallucinations mood swings slurred speech changes in appetite changes in energy level Parkinson’s disease destroys chemical-receiving cells in the brain. Over time, this can lead to dramatic changes, symptoms, and complications. Certain people are more likely to develop Parkinson’s disease dementia. Risk factors for the condition include: Sex.Men are more likely to develop it. Age.The risk increases as you get older. Existing cognitive impairment.If you had memory and mood issues before a Parkinson’s diagnosis, your risk may be higher for dementia. Severe Parkinson’s symptoms.You may be more at risk for Parkinson’s disease dementia if you have severe motor impairment, such as rigid muscles and difficulty walking. Currently, there’s no treatment for Parkinson’s disease dementia. Instead, a doctor will focus on treating other symptoms. Sometimes medications used for other types of dementia can be helpful.Learn more about signs and symptoms of this type of dementia and how it can be diagnosed. This is the most common Parkinson’s disease stage system, butalternative staging systems for Parkinson’s are sometimes used."
1048,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s heredity,"Researchers believe both your genes and the environment may play a role in whether you get Parkinson’s. How much of an impact they have, however, is unknown. Most cases occur in people with no apparent family history of the disease. Hereditary cases of Parkinson’s are rare. It’s uncommon for parents to pass Parkinson’s to a child. According to the National Institutes of Health, only15 percentof people with Parkinson’s have a family history of the disease.See what other genetic factors may influence your risk for developing Parkinson’s."
1049,Parkinson's Disease,Is there a cure for Parkinson’s?,"There’s currently no cure for Parkinson’s, a disease that is chronic and worsens over time. More than 50,000 new cases are reported in the United States each year. But there may be even more, since Parkinson’s is often misdiagnosed. It’s reported that Parkinson’s complications was the14th major cause of deathin the United States in 2016."
1050,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s prognosis,"Complications from Parkinson’s can greatly reduce quality of life and prognosis. For example, individuals with Parkinson’s can experience dangerous falls, as well as blood clots in the lungs and legs. These complications can be fatal. Proper treatment improves your prognosis, and it increases life expectancy. It may not be possible to slow the progression of Parkinson’s, but you can work to overcome the obstacles and complications to have a better quality of life for as long as possible."
1051,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s life expectancy,"Parkinson’s disease is not fatal. However, Parkinson’s-related complications can shorten the lifespan of people diagnosed with the disease. Having Parkinson’s increases a person’s risk for potentially life threatening complications, like experiencing: falls blood clots lung infections blockages in the lungs These complications can cause severe health issues. They can even be fatal. It’s unclear how much Parkinson’s reduces a person’slife expectancy. One study looked at the 6-year survival rates of nearly 140,000 people who had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s. In that 6-year span64 percentof people with Parkinson’s died. What’s more, the study found that70 percentof people in the study had been diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease dementia during the span of the study. Those who were diagnosed with the memory disorder had lower survival rates. Learn more about what impacts survival rate for people with Parkinson’s disease and how you might be able to preventpremature death."
1052,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s exercises,"Parkinson’s often causes problems with daily activities. But verysimple exercisesand stretches may help you move around and walk more safely. Walk carefully. Pace yourself — try not to move too quickly. Let your heel hit the floor first. Check your posture and stand up straight. This will help you shuffle less. Do not walk backward. Try to not carry things while walking. Try to avoid leaning and reaching. To turn around, make a U-turn. Do not pivot on your feet. Remove all tripping hazards in your house such as loose rugs. Allow yourself plenty of time to get ready. Avoid rushing. Select clothes that are easy to put on and take off. Try using items with Velcro instead of buttons. Try wearing pants and skirts with elastic waist bands. These may be easier than buttons and zippers. Yoga uses targeted muscle movement to build muscle, increase mobility, and improve flexibility. People with Parkinson’s may notice yoga even helps manage tremors in some affected limbs.Try these 10 yoga poses to help ease symptoms of Parkinson’s."
1053,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s diet,"For people diagnosed with Parkinson’s, diet can play an important role in daily life. While it will not treat or prevent progression, a healthy diet may have some significant impact. Parkinson’s is the result of decreased dopamine levels in the brain. You may be able to increase levels of the hormone naturally with food. Likewise, a nutrient-rich, balanced diet that focuses on specific nutrients may be able to help reduce some symptoms and prevent progression of the disease. These foods include: Foods high in these substances may help prevent oxidative stress and damage to the brain.Antioxidant-rich foodsinclude nuts, berries, and nightshade vegetables. These lime green beans contain levodopa, the same ingredient used in some Parkinson’s medications. These heart- and brain-healthy fats in salmon, oyster, flaxseed, and some beans may help protect your brain from damage. In addition to eating more of these beneficial foods, you may want to avoid dairy and saturated fat. These food groups may increase your risk for Parkinson’s or speed up progression. Read more about how these foods affect your brain and other things you can change in your diet to improve symptoms of Parkinson’s."
1054,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s and dopamine,"Parkinson’s disease is a neurodegenerative disorder. It affects the dopamine-producing neurons (dopaminergic) in the brain. Dopamine is a brain chemical and neurotransmitter. It helps send electric signals around the brain and through the body. The disease prevents these cells from making dopamine, and it may impair how well the brain can use dopamine. Over time, the cells will die entirely. Thedrop in dopamineis often gradual. That’s why symptoms progress, or slowly get worse. Many Parkinson’s medications are dopaminergic drugs. They aim to increase the level of dopamine or make it more effective on the brain."
1055,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s vs. MS,"At first glance, Parkinson’s disease andmultiple sclerosis (MS)may seem very similar. They both affect the central nervous system, and they can produce many similar symptoms. These include: tremors slurred speech poor balance and instability changes in movement and gait muscle weakness or loss of muscle coordination The two conditions are very different, however. The key differences include: MS is an autoimmune disorder. Parkinson’s is the result of decreased dopamine levels in the brain. MS primarily affects younger individuals, with the average age of diagnosis being between ages 20 and 50 years old. Parkinson’s is more common in people over 60 years old. People with MS experienceconditions like headaches, hearing loss, pain, and double vision. Parkinson’s can ultimately cause muscle rigidity and difficulty walking, poor posture, loss of muscle control, hallucinations, and dementia. If you’re showing unusual symptoms, your doctor may consider both of these conditions when making a diagnosis. Imaging tests and blood tests may be used to help distinguish between the two conditions."
1056,Parkinson's Disease,Parkinson’s prevention,"Doctors and researchers do not understand what causes Parkinson’s. They’re also not sure why it progresses differently in each person. That’s why it’s unclear regarding how to prevent the disease. Each year, researchers investigate why Parkinson’s occurs and what can be done to prevent it.Recent researchsuggests lifestyle factors — like physical exercise and a diet rich in antioxidants — may have a protective effect. If you have a family history of Parkinson’s, you may consider genetic testing. Certain genes have been connected to Parkinson’s. But it’s important to know that having these gene mutations does not mean you’ll definitely develop the disease. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of genetic testing."
1057,Parkinson's Disease,Outlook,Experts are still unsure what causes Parkinson’s. It is a lifelong condition that can be managed with lifestyle changes and medical treatments. Talk with your doctor if you are experiencing symptoms of Parkinson’s or if you have been diagnosed and are looking for new ways to manage the condition.
1058,Personality Disorders,What is a personality disorder?,"Personality disorders are a group of mental health conditions that are characterized by inflexible and atypical patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving. These inner experiences and behaviors often differ from the expectations of the culture in which someone lives. If you have a personality disorder, you may have a difficult time relating to others and dealing with everyday problems in the ways that are expected by your cultural group. You may not be fully aware of this discrepancy between your thoughts and behaviors and those accepted by society. You may have a view of the world that’s quite different than that of others. As a result, you could find it difficult to participate in social, educational, and family activities. These behaviors and attitudes often cause problems and limitations in relationships, social encounters, and work or school settings. They may also make people you feel isolated, which can contribute todepressionandanxiety. Personality disorders are treatable, however. Often a combination of talk therapy and medication can go a long way in helping you live with one of these conditions."
1059,Personality Disorders,What causes personality disorders?,"The cause of personality disorders isn’t known. However, it’s believed that they may be triggered by genetic and environmental influences, most prominently childhood trauma. Personality disorders tend to emerge in the teenage years or early adulthood. The symptoms vary depending on the specific type of personality disorder. For all of them, treatment typically includes talk therapy and medication."
1060,Personality Disorders,What are the different types of personality disorders?,"There are numerous types of personality disorders. They’re grouped into three clusters based on similar characteristics and symptoms. Some people may have signs and symptoms of multiple personality disorders. Paranoid personality disorder.People withparanoid personality disordermay be distrustful of others and suspicious of their motives. Schizoid personality disorder.People withschizoid personality disordercan display little interest in forming personal relationships or partaking in social interactions. They can have trouble interpreting social cues, causing them to seem emotionally distant. Schizotypal personality disorder.People withschizotypal personality disorderoften believe that they can influence other people or events with their thoughts. They may misinterpret behaviors, leading to inappropriate emotional responses. They may also avoid having intimate relationships. Antisocial personality disorder.People withantisocial personality disordertend to manipulate or treat others without expressing remorse for their actions. They may engage in dishonest behavior like lying and stealing, and they may be prone to heavy alcohol and drug use. Borderline personality disorder.People withborderline personality disorderoften feel empty and abandoned, regardless of family or community support. They may have difficulty dealing with stressful events and have episodes of paranoia. They also tend to engage in risky and impulsive behavior, such as binge drinking and gambling. Histrionic personality disorder.People withhistrionic personality disorderfrequently try to gain more attention by being dramatic or provocative. They may be easily influenced by other people and are sensitive to criticism or disapproval. Narcissistic personality disorder.People withnarcissistic personality disorderoften believe that they’re more important than others. They tend to exaggerate their achievements and may brag about their attractiveness or success. Other symptoms include a deep need for admiration but lack empathy for other people. Avoidant personality disorder.People withavoidant personality disorderoften experience feelings of inadequacy, inferiority, or unattractiveness. They may dwell on criticism from others and avoid participating in new activities or making new friends. Dependent personality disorder.People withdependent personality disorderdepend on other people to meet their emotional and physical needs. They usually avoid being alone and regularly need reassurance when making decisions. They may also be more likely to tolerate physical and verbal abuse. Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder.People withobsessive-compulsive personality disorderhave an overwhelming need for order. They strongly adhere to rules and regulations, and they feel extremely uncomfortable when perfection isn’t achieved. They may even neglect personal relationships to focus on making a project perfect."
1061,Personality Disorders,How is a personality disorder diagnosed?,"The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), is a reference that doctors and mental health professionals use to help diagnose mental health conditions. Each personality disorder has criteria that must be met for a diagnosis. A primary care doctor or mental health professional will ask you questions based on these criteria to determine the type of personality disorder. In order for a diagnosis to be made, the behaviors and feelings must be consistent across many life circumstances. They should also cause significant distress and impairment in at least two of the following areas: the way you perceive or interpret yourself and other people the way you act when dealing with other people the appropriateness of your emotional responses how well you can control your impulses In some cases, your primary care doctor or mental health professional may perform blood tests to determine whether a medical problem is causing your symptoms. In some cases, they may order a screening test for alcohol or drugs if they think substances are causing your symptoms."

1064,Personality Disorders,What is the outlook for someone with a personality disorder?,"The most important aspect of treating a personality disorder is determining the condition in the first place. When you recognize that you have a mental health condition, it will be easier for you to seek and stick with treatment. Once you find a treatment that works for you, you should see an improvement in your symptoms. You may have to try a few different types of treatment to find what works best. That’s OK. What matters is that you find a good fit."
1065,Phobias,Overview,"What are phobias? A phobia is an excessive and irrational fear reaction. If you have a phobia, you may experience a deep sense of dread or panic when you encounter the source of your fear. The fear can be of a certain place, situation, or object. Unlike general anxiety disorders, a phobia is usually connected to something specific. The impact of a phobia can range from annoying to severely disabling. People with phobias often realize their fear is irrational, but they’re unable to do anything about it. Such fears can interfere with work, school, and personal relationships. An estimated19 million Americanshave a phobia that causes difficulty in some area of their lives. Seek the help of your doctor if you have a fear that prevents you from leading your fullest life."
1066,Phobias,Causes,"Genetic and environmental factors can cause phobias. Children who have a close relative with ananxiety disorderare at risk of developing a phobia. Distressing events, such as nearly drowning, can bring on a phobia. Exposure to confined spaces, extreme heights, andanimalorinsectbites can all be sources of phobias. People with ongoing medical conditions or health concerns often have phobias. There’s a high incidence of people developing phobias aftertraumatic brain injuries.Substance abuseanddepressionare also connected to phobias. Phobias have different symptoms from serious mental illnesses such asschizophrenia. In schizophrenia, people have visual and auditory hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, negative symptoms such as anhedonia, and disorganized symptoms. Phobias may be irrational, but people with phobias do not fail reality testing."
1067,Phobias,Agoraphobia,Agoraphobiais a fear of places or situations that you can’t escape from. The word itself refers to “fear of open spaces.” People with agoraphobia fear being in large crowds or trapped outside the home. They often avoid social situations altogether and stay inside their homes. Many people with agoraphobia fear they may have apanic attackin a place where they can’t escape. Those with chronic health problems may fear they will have a medical emergency in a public area or where no help is available.
1068,Phobias,Social phobia,"Social phobia is also referred to associal anxiety disorder. It’s extreme worry about social situations and it can lead to self-isolation. A social phobia can be so severe that the simplest interactions, such as ordering at a restaurant or answering the telephone, can cause panic. People with social phobia often go out of their way to avoid public situations."
1069,Phobias,Other types of phobias,"Many people dislike certain situations or objects, but to be a true phobia, the fear must interfere with daily life. Here are a few more of the most common ones: Glossophobia:This is known as performance anxiety, or the fear of speaking in front of an audience. People with this phobia have severe physical symptoms when they even think about being in front of a group of people. <Glossophobia treatments can include either therapy or medication. Acrophobia:This is the fear of heights. People with this phobia avoid mountains, bridges, or the higher floors of buildings. Symptoms includevertigo,dizziness,sweating, and feeling as if they’llpass outor lose consciousness. Claustrophobia:This is a fear of enclosed or tight spaces. Severe claustrophobia can be especially disabling if it prevents you from riding in cars or elevators. <Learn more about claustrophobia, from additional symptoms to treatment options. Aviophobia:This is also known as thefear of flying. Dentophobia:Dentophobia is a fear of the dentist or dental procedures. This phobia generally develops after an unpleasant experience at a dentist’s office. It can be harmful if it prevents you from obtaining neededdental care. Hemophobia:This is a phobia of blood or injury. A person with hemophobia may faint when they come in contact with their own blood or another person’s blood. Arachnophobia:This means fear of spiders. Cynophobia:This is a fear of dogs. Ophidiophobia:People with this phobia fear snakes. Nyctophobia: Thisphobiais a fear of the nighttime or darkness. It almost always begins as a typical childhood fear. When it progresses past adolescence, it’s considered a phobia."
1070,Phobias,Risk factors,"People with a genetic predisposition toanxietymay be at high risk of developing a phobia. Age, socioeconomic status, and gender seem to be risk factors only for certain phobias. For example, women are more likely to have animal phobias. Children or people with a low socioeconomic status are more likely to have social phobias. Men make up the majority of those with dentist and doctor phobias."
1071,Phobias,Symptoms of phobias,"The most common and disabling symptom of a phobia is a panic attack. Features of a panic attack include: poundingorracing heart shortness of breath rapid speech or inability to speak dry mouth upset stomach nausea elevated blood pressure trembling or shaking chest painor tightness a choking sensation dizzinessorlightheadedness profuse sweating a sense of impending doom A person with a phobia doesn’t have to have panic attacks for accurate diagnosis, however."
1072,Phobias,Treatment options,"Treatment for phobias can involve therapeutic techniques, medications, or a combination of both. Read our review of thebest online therapy optionsto find the right fit for you. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)is the most commonly used therapeutic treatment for phobias. It involves exposure to the source of the fear in a controlled setting. This treatment can decondition people and reduce anxiety. The therapy focuses on identifying and changing negative thoughts, dysfunctional beliefs, and negative reactions to the phobic situation. New CBT techniques use virtual reality technology to expose people to the sources of their phobias safely. Antidepressantsandanti-anxiety medicationscan help calm emotional and physical reactions to fear. Often, a combination of medication and professional therapy is the most helpful."
1073,Phobias,Takeaway,"If you have a phobia, it’s critical that you seek treatment. Overcoming phobias can be difficult, but there’s hope. With the right treatment, you can learn to manage your fears and lead a productive, fulfilling life."
1074,Pneumonia,Overview,"Pneumonia is an infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. It leads to inflammation in the air sacs of one or both lungs. These sacs, called alveoli, fill with fluid or pus, making it difficult to breathe. Bothviralandbacterialpneumonia iscontagious. This means they can spread from person to person through inhalation of airborne droplets from a sneeze or cough. You can also get these types of pneumonia by coming into contact with surfaces or objects that are contaminated with pneumonia-causing bacteria or viruses. You can contract fungal pneumonia from the environment. It does not spread from person to person."
1075,Pneumonia,Types of pneumonia,"Pneumonia is further classified according to where or how it was acquired: Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP).This type of bacterial pneumonia is acquired during a hospital stay. It can be more serious than other types, as the bacteria involved may be more resistant to antibiotics. Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP).This refers to pneumonia that’s acquired outside of a medical or institutional setting. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP).When people who are using a ventilator get pneumonia, it’s called VAP. Aspiration pneumonia.Inhaling bacteria into your lungs from food, drink, or saliva can causeaspiration pneumonia. It’s more likely to occur if you have a swallowing problem, or if you’re too sedated from the use of medications, alcohol, or other drugs. Walking pneumoniais a milder case of pneumonia. People with walking pneumonia may not even know they have pneumonia. Their symptoms may feel more like a mild respiratory infection than pneumonia. However, walking pneumonia may require a longer recovery period. The symptoms of walking pneumonia can include things like: mild fever dry cough lasting longer than a week chills shortness of breath chest pain reduced appetite Viruses and bacteria, likeStreptococcus pneumoniaeorHaemophilus influenzae, often cause pneumonia. However, in walking pneumonia, the bacteriaMycoplasma pneumoniaemost commonly causes the condition. Learn more about pneumonia during pregancy (maternal pneumonia)."
1076,Pneumonia,Pneumonia stages,"Pneumonia may be classified based off the area of the lungs it’s affecting: Bronchopneumoniacan affect areas throughout both of your lungs. It’s often localized close to or around your bronchi. These are the tubes that lead from your windpipe to your lungs. Lobar pneumonia affects one or more lobes of your lungs. Each lung is made of lobes, which are defined sections of the lung. Lobar pneumonia can be further divided into four stages based off how it’s progressed: Congestion.Lung tissue appears heavy and congested. Fluid filled with infectious organisms has accumulated in the air sacs. Red hepatization.Red bloods cells and immune cells have entered into the fluid. This makes the lungs appear red and solid in appearance. Gray hepatization.The red blood cells have begun to break down while immune cells remain. The breakdown of red blood cells causes a change in color, from red to gray. Resolution.Immune cells have begun to clear the infection. A productive cough helps eject remaining fluid from the lungs."
1077,Pneumonia,Symptoms of pneumonia,"Pneumonia symptoms can be mild to life threatening. They can include: coughingthat may producephlegm(mucus) fever sweating orchills shortness of breaththat happens while doing normal activities, or even while resting chest painthat’s worse when you breathe or cough feelings of tiredness or fatigue loss of appetite nausea or vomiting headaches Other symptoms can vary according to your age and general health: Infants may appear to have no symptoms, but sometimes they may vomit, lack energy, or have trouble drinking or eating. Children under 5 years old may have fast breathing or wheezing. Older adults may have milder symptoms. They can also experience confusion or a lower-than-normal body temperature."
1078,Pneumonia,Causes of pneumonia,"Pneumonia happens when germs get into your lungs and cause an infection. The immune system’s reaction to clear the infection results in inflammation of the lung’s air sacs (alveoli). This inflammation can eventually cause the air sacs to fill up with pus and liquids, causing pneumonia symptoms. Several types of infectious agents can cause pneumonia, including bacteria, viruses, and fungi. The most common cause ofbacterial pneumoniaisStreptococcus pneumoniae. Other causes include: Mycoplasma pneumoniae Haemophilus influenzae Legionella pneumophila Respiratory viruses are often the cause of pneumonia. Examples of viral infections that can cause pneumonia include: influenza (flu) respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) rhinoviruses(common cold) humanparainfluenzavirus (HPIV) infection human metapneumovirus (HMPV) infection measles chickenpox(varicella-zoster virus) adenovirusinfection coronavirus infection SARS-CoV-2 infection (the virus that causes COVID-19) Although the symptoms of viral and bacterial pneumonia are very similar,viral pneumoniais usually milder. It can improve in 1 to 3 weeks without treatment. According to theNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, people with viral pneumonia are at risk of developing bacterial pneumonia. Fungi from soil or bird droppings can cause pneumonia. They most often cause pneumonia in people withweakened immune systems. Examples of fungi that can cause pneumonia include: Pneumocystis jirovecii Cryptococcusspecies Histoplasmosisspecies Coccidioidesspecies Anyone can get pneumonia, but certain groups do have a higher risk. These groups include: infants from birth to 2 years old people ages 65 and older people with weakened immune systems due to:pregnancyHIVthe use of certain medications, such as steroids or certain cancer drugs pregnancy HIV the use of certain medications, such as steroids or certain cancer drugs people with certain chronic medical conditions, such as:asthmacystic fibrosisdiabetesCOPDheart failuresickle cell diseaseliver diseasekidney disease asthma cystic fibrosis diabetes COPD heart failure sickle cell disease liver disease kidney disease people who’ve been recently or are currently hospitalized, particularly if they were or are on a ventilator people who’ve had a brain disorder, which can affect the ability to swallow or cough, such as:strokehead injurydementiaParkinson’s disease stroke head injury dementia Parkinson’s disease people who’ve been regularly exposed to lung irritants, such as air pollution and toxic fumes, especially on the job people who live in a crowded living environment, such as a prison or nursing home people who smoke, which makes it more difficult for the body to get rid of mucus in the airways people who use drugs or drink heavy amounts of alcohol, which weakens the immune system and increases the odds of inhaling saliva or vomit into the lungs due to sedation"
1079,Pneumonia,Diagnosng pneumonia,"Your doctor will start by taking your medical history. They’ll ask you questions about when your symptoms first appeared and your health in general. They’ll then give you a physical exam. This will include listening to your lungs with a stethoscope for any abnormal sounds, such ascrackling. Depending on the severity of your symptoms and your risk of complications, your doctor may also order one or more of these tests: AnX-rayhelps your doctor look for signs of inflammation in your chest. If inflammation is present, the X-ray can also inform your doctor about its location and extent. This test uses a blood sample to confirm an infection. Culturing can also help identify what may be causing your condition. During asputum culture, a sample of mucus is collected after you’ve coughed deeply. It’s then sent to a lab to be analyzed to identify the cause of the infection. Apulse oximetrymeasures the amount of oxygen in your blood. A sensor placed on one of your fingers can indicate whether your lungs are moving enough oxygen through your bloodstream. CT scansprovide a clearer and more detailed picture of your lungs. If your doctor suspects there’sfluid in the pleural spaceof your chest, they may take afluid sampleusing a needle placed between your ribs. This test can help identify the cause of your infection. Abronchoscopylooks into the airways in your lungs. It does this using a camera on the end of a flexible tube that’s gently guided down your throat and into your lungs. Your doctor may do this test if your initial symptoms are severe, or if you’re hospitalized and not responding well to antibiotics. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
1080,Pneumonia,Treating pneumonia,"Your treatment will depend on the type of pneumonia you have, how severe it is, and your general health. Your doctor may prescribe a medication to help treat your pneumonia. What you’re prescribed will depend on the specific cause of your pneumonia. Oralantibioticscan treat most cases of bacterial pneumonia. Always take your entire course of antibiotics, even if you begin to feel better. Not doing so can prevent the infection from clearing, and it may be harder to treat in the future. Antibiotic medications don’t work on viruses. In some cases, your doctor may prescribe an antiviral. However, many cases of viral pneumonia clear on their own with at-home care. Antifungal medications are used to treat fungal pneumonia. You may have to take this medication for several weeks to clear the infection. Your doctor may also recommend over-the-counter (OTC) medications to relieve your pain and fever, as needed. These may include: aspirin ibuprofen(Advil, Motrin) acetaminophen(Tylenol) Your doctor may also recommend cough medicine to calm your cough so you can rest. Keep in mind coughing helps remove fluid from your lungs, so you don’t want to eliminate it entirely. Although home remedies don’t actually treat pneumonia, there are some things you can do to help ease symptoms. Coughing is one of the most common symptoms of pneumonia. Natural ways to relieve a cough include gargling salt water or drinking peppermint tea. Cool compresses can work to relieve a fever. Drinking warm water or having a nice warm bowl of soup can help with chills.Here are more home remedies to try. You can help your recovery and prevent a recurrence by getting a lot of rest and drinking plenty of fluids. Although home remedies can help ease symptoms, it’s important to stick to your treatment plan. Take any prescribed medications as directed. If your symptoms are very severe or you have other health problems, you may need to be hospitalized. At the hospital, doctors can keep track of your heart rate, temperature, and breathing. Hospital treatment may include: antibiotics injected into a vein respiratory therapy, which involves delivering specific medications directly into the lungs, or teaching you to perform breathing exercises to maximize your oxygenation oxygen therapyto maintain oxygen levels in your bloodstream (received through a nasal tube, face mask, or ventilator, depending on severity)"
1081,Pneumonia,Complications of pneumonia,"Pneumonia may cause complications, especially in people withweakened immune systemsor chronic conditions, such asdiabetes. Complications may include: Worsened chronic conditions.If you have certain preexisting health conditions, pneumonia could make them worse. These conditions includecongestive heart failureandemphysema. For certain people, pneumonia increases their risk of having aheart attack. Bacteremia.Bacteria from the pneumonia infectionmay spread to your bloodstream. This can lead to dangerously low blood pressure,septic shock, and, in some cases, organ failure. Lung abscesses.These are cavities in the lungs that contain pus. Antibiotics can treat them. Sometimes they may require drainage or surgery to remove the pus. Impaired breathing.You may have trouble getting enough oxygen when you breathe. You may need to use a ventilator. Acute respiratory distress syndrome.This is a severe form of respiratory failure. It’s a medical emergency. Pleural effusion.If your pneumonia isn’t treated, you may develop fluid around your lungs in your pleura, calledpleural effusion. The pleura are thin membranes that line the outside of your lungs and the inside of your rib cage. The fluid may become infected and need to be drained. Kidney, heart, and liver damage.These organs may be damaged if they don’t receive enough oxygen, or if there’s an overreaction of the immune system to the infection. Death.In some cases, pneumoniacan be fatal. According to the CDC,nearly 44,000 peoplein the United States died from pneumonia in 2019."
1082,Pneumonia,Preventing pneumonia,"In many cases, pneumonia can be prevented. The first line of defense against pneumonia is to get vaccinated. There are several vaccines that can help prevent pneumonia. These two pneumonia vaccines help protect against pneumonia andmeningitiscaused by pneumococcal bacteria. Your doctor can tell you which one might be better for you. Prevnar 13is effective against 13 types of pneumococcal bacteria. TheCDCrecommends this vaccine for: children under age 2 people between ages 2 and 64 with chronic conditions that increase their risk of pneumonia adults ages 65 and older, on the recommendation of their doctor Pneumovax 23is effective against 23 types of pneumococcal bacteria. TheCDCrecommends it for: adults ages 65 and older adults ages 19 to 64 who smoke people between ages 2 and 64 with chronic conditions that increase their risk of pneumonia Pneumonia can often be a complication of the flu, so be sure to also get an annualflu shot. TheCDCrecommends that everyone ages 6 months and older get vaccinated, particularly those who may be at risk of flu complications. COVID-19 can lead to pneumonia. TheCDCrecommends that everyone 6 months and older should receive an updated COVID-19 vaccine. This vaccine protects againstHaemophilus influenzaetype b (Hib), a type of bacterium that can cause pneumonia and meningitis. TheCDCrecommends this vaccine for: all children under 5 years old unvaccinated older children or adults who have certain health conditions people who’ve gotten a bone marrow transplant According to theNational Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, pneumonia vaccines won’t prevent all cases of the condition. But if you’re vaccinated, you’re likely to have a milder and shorter illness as well as a lower risk of complications. In addition to vaccination, there are other things you can do to avoid pneumonia: If you smoke, try toquit. Smoking makes you more susceptible to respiratory infections, especially pneumonia. Regularly wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. Cover your coughs and sneezes. Promptly dispose used tissues. Maintain a healthy lifestyle to strengthen your immune system. Get enoughrest, eat abalanced diet, and getregular exercise. Together with vaccination and additional prevention steps, you can help reduce your risk of getting pneumonia.Here are even more prevention tips."
1083,Pneumonia,Is pneumonia curable?,"A variety of infectious agents cause pneumonia. With proper recognition and treatment, many cases of pneumonia can be cleared without complications. For bacterial infections, stopping your antibiotics early can cause the infection to not clear completely. This means your pneumonia could come back. Stopping antibiotics early can also contribute to antibiotic resistance. Antibiotic-resistant infections are more difficult to treat. Viral pneumonia often resolves in 1 to 3 weeks with at-home treatment. In some cases, you may need antivirals. Antifungal medications treat fungal pneumonia. It may require a longer period of treatment. Pneumonia can become dangerous quickly, particularly in young children.Here’s how to avoid complications."
1084,Pneumonia,Outlook,"Most people respond to treatment and recover from pneumonia. Like your treatment, your recovery time will depend on the type of pneumonia you have, how severe it is, and your general health. A younger person may feel back to normal in a week after treatment. Others may take longer to recover and may have lingering fatigue. If your symptoms are severe, your recovery may take several weeks. Consider taking these steps to aid in your recovery and help prevent complications from occurring: Stick to the treatment plan your doctor has developed, and take all medications as instructed. Make sure to get plenty of rest to help your body fight the infection. Drink plenty of fluids. Ask your doctor when you should schedule a follow-up appointment. They may want to perform another chest X-ray to make sure your infection has cleared."
1085,Pneumonia,Summary,"Pneumonia is a lung infection caused by bacteria, viruses, or fungi. The immune system’s reaction to this infection causes the lung’s air sacs to fill with pus and fluids. This leads to symptoms such as trouble breathing, a cough with or without mucus, fever, and chills. To diagnose pneumonia, your doctor will do a physical exam and discuss your medical history. They may recommend further testing, such as a chest X-ray. Treatment depends on the cause of the infection. It may involve antibiotics, antiviral medication, or antifungal medication. Pneumonia often clears up in a few weeks. See a doctor right away if your symptoms get worse, as you may need to be hospitalized to prevent or treat more serious complications."
1086,Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS),Overview,"PMS is the changes in mood, emotions, physical health, and behavior that can occur between ovulation and the start of your period. It typically lasts until a few days after your period begins and can have a negative impact on your life. Pre-menstrual syndrome (PMS) is a very common concern. Nearly48 percentof women who are of reproductive age experience PMS, and for about 20 percent of them, symptoms are severe enough to affect their regular routine. Contrary to what some people may suggest, PMS is a real condition, one that can disrupt daily life and cause significant physical discomfort and emotional distress. Below, we’ll cover the symptoms of PMS in detail, plus offer some tips on getting support and relief from your symptoms."
1087,Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS),Symptoms of PMS,"While PMS often involves mild or moderate symptoms that don’t majorly affect daily life, symptomscanbe severe enough to impact your everyday activities and overall well-being. If you have PMS, you’ll experience symptoms consistently before each menstrual period. You might experience only some of the symptoms below, or several, but PMS typically involves at least a few different symptoms. PMS-related changes in your mood, emotions, and behavior might include: anxiety, restlessness, or feeling on edge unusual anger andirritability changes in appetite, includingincreased food cravings, especially for sweets changes in sleep patterns, including fatigue and trouble sleeping a sad or low mood, which might involve tearfulness or sudden, uncontrollable crying rapid shifts in moodand emotional outbursts decreasedsex drive difficulty concentratingor remembering information With PMS, you’ll likely also notice some physical symptoms, such as: abdominal bloating cramping sore and swollen breasts acne constipation diarrhea headaches back and muscle pain unusual sensitivity to light or sound unusual clumsiness On average, the menstrual cycle lasts about 28 days. If you have an average-length cycle: Ovulation, or the egg’s release from the ovaries, will occur around day 14, or the midpoint of the cycle. PMS symptoms can begin any time after ovulation (though they typically begin in the week before your period) and last until 5 or so days after menstruation begins. Menstruation, or bleeding, will begin on day 28 of the cycle. Learn more about the stages of the menstrual cycle."
1088,Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS),What causes PMS?,"Scientific research hasn’t led to a conclusive cause of PMS, or an explanation for why some people experience it more severely than others. That said, researchers have suggested a few different theories. Many experts believe PMS happens in response to changing levels of thehormonesestrogen and progesterone. These hormones naturally fluctuate throughout your menstrual cycle. During the luteal phase, which follows ovulation, hormones reach a peak and then decline rapidly, which may lead to anxiety, irritability, and other changes in mood. The neurotransmittersserotoninandnorepinephrinehave several important functions in the body, including helping regulate mood, emotions, and behavior. These chemical messengers may also factor into symptoms of PMS. For example, a drop in estrogen may prompt the release of norepinephrine, which leads to declining production ofdopamine, acetylcholine, and serotonin. These changes can trigger sleep problems and lead to a low or depressed mood. Living with a mental health condition, such asdepressionoranxiety, could raise your chances of experiencing PMS or premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD), a more severe form of PMS. A family history of PMS,bipolar disorder, or depression, includingpostpartum depression, can also increase this risk. You might also noticepremenstrual exacerbation. This means symptoms of underlying mental health conditions, like bipolar disorder or depression, intensify shortly before your period begins. Experts have yet to arrive at a conclusive explanation for the link between mental health symptoms and menstruation-related mood changes. But many believe it relates to the chemical changes in the brain discussed above. Certain habits might affect the severity of your PMS symptoms. Potential lifestyle factors that could worsen PMS symptoms include: smoking eating a lot of foodshigh in fat, sugar, and salt a lack of regular physical activity a lack of quality sleep Research from 2018also links alcohol use to increased risk of PMS. If youbinge drink or drink heavilyon a regular basis, you’re even more likely to experience PMS symptoms."
1089,Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS),Could it be PMDD?,"PMDD, which tends to involves more drastic and overwhelming changes in mood, can have a major impact on day-to-day life. The most recent edition of the “Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5)” recognizes PMDD as a mental health condition. An estimated3 to 8 percentof menstruating women experience PMDD. That said, the actual number of people living with PMDD could be higher. Many people never seek help for symptoms, and those who do often experience dismissal and lack of support from healthcare professionals. As with PMS, PMDD symptoms may occur due to fluctuations in levels of estrogen, progesterone, andserotonin. Symptoms of PMDD might include: depression, intense sadness, andcrying spells thoughts of suicide panic attacks anxiety, anger, or irritability sudden shifts in mood a lack of interest in daily activities insomnia trouble thinking or focusing binge eating painful cramping bloating It can be tough to talk about intense emotions or persistent thoughts of death, dying, or suicide.

1090,Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS),When to reach out to a doctor,"Most people who menstruate report at least a few symptoms of PMS, but these symptoms won’t necessarily show up every month or affect your everyday life. If PMS symptoms become severe enough to disrupt your regular routine on a monthly basis, a good next step involves reaching out to a doctor or clinician. Healthcare professionals can diagnose PMS or PMDD and help you explore potential options for treatment, such as: hormonal birth control supplements, including calcium, magnesium, or vitamin B6 mefenamic acid To make an accurate diagnosis, they may: ask about your personal and family history of PMS, PMDD, and other mood and mental health conditions ask about your family history of other health conditions, includinghypothyroidismorendometriosis recommend apelvic examto rule out gynecological conditions, depending on your symptoms suggest keeping a diary and calendar to track menstruation and any related symptoms you experience for 2 to 3 months If your symptoms show up consistently during the luteal phase of the menstrual cycle and disappear shortly after your period begins, a healthcare professional may diagnose PMS. On the other hand, if they linger throughout the entire month or come and go without any regularity, they may link them to premenstrual exacerbation or another health condition. Other conditions that may involve similar symptoms include: anemia endometriosis thyroid disorder irritable bowel syndrome(IBS) chronic fatigue syndrome"
1091,Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS),Easing the symptoms of PMS,"While there’s no cure for PMS, youcantake steps to ease your symptoms. To get relief from mild or moderate symptoms, it may help to give the following strategies a try: Drink plenty of fluids to ease abdominal bloating. This includesherbal teas, like red raspberry leaf orchamomile, which may ease cramping. Eat abalanced dietthat includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Consider cutting back onsugar, salt, caffeine, and alcohol, especially if you’re particularly sensitive to their effects. Ask a healthcare professional about trying supplements likefolic acid,vitamin B-6,calcium, andmagnesiumto help reduce cramps and mood symptoms. Try getting morevitamin Dvianatural light,food, orsupplements. Aim to get7 to 9 hours of sleepeach night to help relieve fatigue and improve overall well-being. Try to getat least half an hourof physical activity each day, if you’re able. Exercise can not only help relieve bloating and cramping, but it can also help ease anxiety and depression symptoms. Set aside time each day forself-care, which might include exercise,relaxation, time to yourself for hobbies, or time for social interaction. Over-the-counter medications and treatments can also help reduce physical PMS symptoms. Options include: pain relievers, like ibuprofen, aspirin, or acetaminophen, for head and muscle aches or stomach cramping diureticsto help relieve bloating and sore or tender breasts heat wraps or heating pads on your abdomen to relieve cramps If you have severe mood symptoms that create complications in your daily life,cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)orother therapy approachescan help you learn new ways to reframe and cope with distressing thoughts and emotions."
1092,Premenstrual Syndrome (PMS),The bottom line,"If PMS symptoms affect your routine and quality of life month after month, and home remedies and over-the-counter medications make little difference, it’s always best to connect with a healthcare professional. Severe PMS symptoms may require a more in-depth treatment approach, but they do often improve with treatment. A doctor or clinician can offer more guidance on developing a personalized treatment plan that makes a difference for you."
1093,Probiotics,Overview,"Probiotics support your health and overall well-being by crowding out harmful pathogens, improving your intestinal barrier function, and promoting neurotransmitter production, among other benefits. Probioticshave become all the rage, making their way into everything from dietary supplements and food additives to shampoos and acne treatments. But what, exactly,areprobiotics, and why are they so beneficial for our health? This article provides a beginner-friendly overview of probiotics and their uses."
1094,Probiotics,What are probiotics?,"Probioticsare microorganisms that provide health benefits when consumed or used in adequate amounts. While commercial probiotic products are mainly made up of bacteria, probiotics can include fungi like yeasts, molds like penicillium, and even some viruses, likebacteriophages. Commonprobiotic strainsinclude: Lactobacillus (bacteria) Bifidobacterium (bacteria) Saccharomyces boulardii (yeast) In their earliest forms, probiotics were limited to dietary supplements, certain foods, and food additives targeting yourgut microbiome, the natural ecosystem of microorganisms in yourdigestive tract. Your gut microbiome helps with the breakdown and absorption of nutrients and plays several important roles in immune system regulation and neurotransmitter production. When you take a probiotic supplement or consume foods rich in probiotics, you help increase the population of beneficial microorganisms in your gut. More beneficial microorganisms in your gut microbiomesupport your gut health by: allowing less room for harmful, disease-causing microorganisms (pathogens) to grow promoting the secretion of substances that inhibit harmful microorganism growth teaching immune cells to differentiate between harmful and beneficial microbes balancing neurotransmitter production regulating energy breakdown, use, and storage in the body strengthening the intestinal lining to prevent pathogens and harmful substances from crossing into the bloodstream promoting mucous production in the gut to reinforce the protective intestinal lining Your gut microbiome isn’t the only place in your body that can benefit from probiotics. As knowledge about the whole-body microbiome and probiotics has increased, so has our understanding of how probiotics benefit other areas, such as the skin and mouth microbiome. In addition to ingested probiotics, topical probiotics are now available to help target these other microorganism ecosystems."
1095,Probiotics,Probiotic sources,"Probiotics occur naturally in foods or can be added to your diet through supplements or probiotic-enriched products. Foods naturally rich in probioticsinclude fermented dairy products such as: yogurt kefir unpasteurized cheese traditional buttermilk And nondairy fermented products, such as: sauerkraut kimchi miso tempeh kombucha pickles (fermented, not vinegar-pickled) natto kvass certain salamis and fermented sausages You can also add probiotics to your regular nonfermented diet by using dietary supplements. Probiotics are available in powders, capsules, tablets, chews, and liquids. When selecting a probiotic, quality is important. Many products are labeled with “live and active cultures” with a colony-forming unit (CFU) of1 billion or higher. CFU counts indicate the number of live microorganisms in a probiotic supplement. For additional quality assurance, aim for products that carry a safety seal, such as: Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) Seal Non-GMO Project Verified United States Pharmacopeia (USP) Verified Looking for probiotics you can trust? Read about ourdietitians’ favorite probiotic supplementsof 2025 and find the best option for you."
1096,Probiotics,Side effects and considerations,"Probiotics have along historyof safe use in healthy people butmay causemild but temporary gastrointestinalside effectssuch as gas, bloating, diarrhea, or upset stomach. Despite their broad safety profile, probiotics aren’t for everyone. Certain populations, like infants, older adults, or people who are immunocompromised, can experience serious side effects. Although rare, probiotics for these groups may contribute to: increased infections sepsis medication interactions difficulties with blood sugar management autoimmune flare-ups Because probiotics can affect your health positively and negatively under different circumstances, talking with your doctor before you add probiotics to your diet can help reduce the chances of experiencing side effects, especially if you live with underlying health conditions."
1097,Probiotics,How to add probiotics to your diet,"Different brands of probiotic products come with their own recommended useinstructions. While someolder evidencesuggests taking your probiotics 30 minutes before a meal can help protect them against digestive acids, many probiotics are now formulated with protective coatings that allow them to be taken even on an empty stomach. To ensure the effectiveness of your probiotic, it’s always best to follow the instructions on the label. Overall, the timing of your probiotic may be less important than your consistency of use. Probioticsdo not typicallyremain in your system long-term or create long-term microorganism colonization. This means your microbiome will return to its baseline state if you stop taking your supplement or take it sporadically. By taking your probiotic at the same time each day or as otherwise directed by the product label, you can keep the level of beneficial microorganisms from the probiotic at its peak. Whether you eat probiotic-rich foods or take a probiotic supplement, making it a habit will support your long-term health goals."
1098,Probiotics,The takeaway,"Probiotics are microorganisms that provide health benefits when used or consumed in adequate amounts. You can add probiotics to your diet through probiotic-rich foods or dietary supplements. While probiotics aren’t for everyone, consistently adding probiotics to your healthcare routine can support long-term microbiome health and overall well-being. Before starting any probiotic routine, check with your doctor to ensure it’s the right choice for you."
1099,Prostate Cancer,Overview,"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer in men, and it occurs when malignant cells form a tumor in the prostate gland, which can then spread to other parts of the body. Risk factors for prostate cancer include being over 50, having a family history of the disease, being African American, and having obesity, but early detection through screening tests like PSA and DRE can improve treatment outcomes. Treatment options for prostate cancer vary based on the stage and aggressiveness of the cancer, ranging from active surveillance for nonaggressive cases to surgery, radiation, and hormone therapy for more aggressive forms."
1100,Prostate Cancer,What’s prostate cancer?,"Prostate cancer is themost commonlydiagnosed cancer in males worldwide. In the United States, the American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that268,490men will be newly diagnosed with this condition in 2022. Theprostateis a small gland found in a man’s lower abdomen, located under the bladder and surrounding the urethra. The hormonetestosteroneregulates the prostate. In addition, the prostate gland produces seminal fluid, also known assemen. Semen is the substance containing sperm that exits the urethra during ejaculation. When an abnormal, malignant growth of cells — which is called a tumor — forms in the prostate, it’s called prostate cancer. This cancer can spread to other areas of the body. In these cases, because the cancer is made of cells from the prostate, it’s still called prostate cancer."
1101,Prostate Cancer,Types of prostate cancer,"Almost all cases of prostate cancer are a type of cancer calledadenocarcinomathat grows in the tissue of a gland, such as the prostate gland. However, other raretypes of cancercan also originate in the prostate, including: small cell carcinoma, such aslung cancer neuroendocrine tumors, such aspancreatic cancer transitional cell carcinomas, such askidney cancer sarcomas, such as bone cell cancer Prostate cancer is also categorized by how fast it grows. It has two types of growth: aggressive, or fast-growing nonaggressive, or slow-growing With nonaggressive prostate cancer, the tumor grows slowly. However, with aggressive cancer, the tumor can overgrow and spread to other body areas, such as the bones, and becomes ametastatic cancer."
1102,Prostate Cancer,Prostate cancer causes and risk factors,"There’s no known cause for prostate cancer, but risk factors such as family history or age may increase your likelihood of developing themalignancy. While prostate cancer could occur in any man, certain factors raise your risk for the disease. Theserisk factorsinclude: older age, 50 years of age or older a family history of prostate cancer certain ethnicities or race — for instance,African American malesare at greater risk of having prostate cancer obesity genetic changes Somestudiesconsider other risk factors like diet and chemical exposure that may increase your diagnosis chances. However, the ACS says those effects are still unclear. Prostate cancer is also rare in men under the age of 40."
1103,Prostate Cancer,Prostate cancer symptoms,"Some forms of prostate cancer are nonaggressive, so you may not have any symptoms. However, advanced prostate cancer often causes symptoms. If you have any of the following signs or symptoms, don’t hesitate to call your doctor. In addition, other conditions can cause some symptoms of prostate cancer, such asbenign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), so you’ll need to check with your doctor to get a proper diagnosis. Symptomsof prostate cancer can include urinary problems, sexual problems, and pain and numbness. Urinary problems are common because the prostate is located beneath the bladder and surrounds the urethra. Because of this location, if a tumor grows on the prostate, it could press on the bladder or urethra and cause problems. Urinary problems can include: frequent need tourinate a stream that’s slower or weaker than normal bleeding while urinating Erectile dysfunctionmay be a symptom of prostate cancer. Also calledimpotence, this condition makes you unable to get and keep an erection. Blood in the semenafter ejaculation can also be a symptom of prostate cancer. You may experienceweaknessornumbnessin the legs and feet. You may also lose control of your bladder and bowel if cancer has spread, causingpressure on your spinal cord."
1104,Prostate Cancer,Early detection of prostate cancer,"One of the best ways to detect cancer before any symptoms appear is to undergo a screening test. The earlier you find cancer, the easier it may be to treat. PSAis a blood test that measures the number of prostate proteins in your blood. If the level is high, it may indicate prostate cancer. The PSA test is a useful tool for your doctor to consider whether or not your PSA levels may indicate prostate cancer. Since early detection is crucial for treating cancer, this is a major benefit. The test is relatively simple and widely available for people with a prostate that want to be screened. However, there are pros and cons to screening. For example, a2018 studyfound that PSA may increase your chances of early detection, but it doesn’t lessen your chances of dying from prostate cancer. The test has some associated concerns and it is important to discuss with your doctor what the risks of PSA screening would mean for you. Otherconcernsto consider about PSA include: accuracy level overdiagnosis and overtreatment tendencies unclear overall benefit Otherfactorscan increase your PSA level, such as: enlarged prostate older age ejaculation prostate infectionor inflammation specific medications When you undergo aDRE, the doctor places their lubricated, gloved finger into your rectum to feel any bumps, rigid, or enlarged areas of the prostate. Since prostate cancer often starts at the back of the gland, it may be detected using this method. Although not as effective as a PSA test, it is more effective among men who have an average PSA level but still have prostate cancer. Using advanced imaging, such asMRIorultrasound, you can detect prostate cancer. In a2018 research article, experts indicated that you can now catch it earlier — and better identify its stage — with improved technologies. Sometimes, your doctor may recommend aprostate biopsyif they suspect cancer from an exam or find that you have an elevated PSA level. During the biopsy, the doctor takes a small sample of your prostate tissue to analyze the cells. If they find the cells are cancerous, it can also help them determine how quickly they may spread and grow. To do this, they determine yourGleason score. The Gleason score is an effective tool to predict your outlook, but it isn’t absolute. There are manyother factorsinvolved when predicting the spread and course of the disease, with experts varying in how they use the scoring system. To be sure, the best way to determine your outlook depends on other predictors in addition to your Gleason scores, like your physical exam and tumor imaging. You’ll receive a Gleason score if you’ve had a prostate biopsy. Pathologists use this score to classify the grade of prostate cancer cells. The grade means how many abnormal cells look like cancer and how aggressive their growth seems. A Gleason score lower than 6 means your cells don’t show signs of cancer, so your risk is low. If your score is 7 or higher, your doctor will likely look at your score and your PSA level to assess the cells. For instance, a Gleason score of 7, with a PSA level between 10 to 20 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL), means they’ve identified cancer cells — but the cancer is likely nonaggressive, with slow-growing cells. A Gleason score of 8 or higher indicates a more advanced tumor with PSA levels greater than 20 ng/mL. That means your risk of aggressive cancer is higher."
1105,Prostate Cancer,Prostate cancer screening by age,"TheACSdoes have screening recommendations for men as they get older. First, they recommend that doctors talk to men about the pros and cons of screening prostate cancer during an annual exam. These conversations should occur for the following ages: Age 40:For men at very high risk, such as those with more than one first-degree relative — a father, brother, or son — who had prostate cancer at an age younger than 65. Age 45:For men at high risk, such as African American men and men with a first-degree relative diagnosed at an age younger than 65. Age 50:For men at average risk of prostate cancer, and who are expected to live at least 10 more years. Before you decide to undergo screening, consider all the information available, including uncertainties, risks, and benefits of prostate cancer screening. Then, you and your doctor can decide which test is best for you, if any."
1106,Prostate Cancer,Prostate cancer stages,"Your doctor can discuss how far cancer has spread by using a staging system. TheAmerican Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TMN staging systemstages prostate cancer. Like many other types of cancer, the system stages it by: the size or extent of thetumor lymph node involvement whether or not cancer has spread (metastasized) to other sites or organs PSA level at the time of diagnosis Gleason score Prostatecancer stagesrange from 1 to 4. However, the disease is most advanced in stage 4."
1107,Prostate Cancer,Prostate cancer treatment,"Your doctor will develop an appropriate treatment plan for your cancer based on your age, health status, and the stage of your cancer. If the cancer is nonaggressive, your doctor may recommend watchful waiting, also called active surveillance. This means you’ll delay treatment but have regular checkups with your doctor to monitor cancer. If your doctor chooses to monitor cancer using active surveillance, they check your PSA every 6 months and perform an annual DRE. In addition, they may do a repeat biopsy and imaging in 1 to 3 years after initial diagnosis. The doctor actively monitors your symptoms alone to decide if treatment is needed when simply observing the disease. Doctors may treat more aggressive types of cancer with other options, such as: surgery radiation cryotherapy hormone therapy chemotherapy stereotactic radiosurgery immunotherapy If your cancer is very aggressive and has metastasized, there’s a good chance it has spread to your bones. Forbone metastases, the above treatments may be used, in addition to others. If your prostate cancer has yet to spread, stage 1-3, doctors use risk groups to plan your treatment. However, advanced stages can lead to more or less treatment. Other factors may also come into play, such as your age and overall health. Note that chemotherapy is used after hormonal therapy is not working for treatment."
1108,Prostate Cancer,Prostatectomy,"A prostatectomy is a surgical procedure removing part or all of your prostate gland. For example, if you have prostate cancer that hasn’t spread outside of the prostate, your doctor may suggest that you have a radical prostatectomy, which removes the entire prostate. There are different types of radical prostatectomies. Some are open, which means you’ll have a larger incision in your lower abdomen. Others are laparoscopic, which means you’ll have several smaller incisions in your stomach."
1109,Prostate Cancer,Outlook,"The outlook is usually good if prostate cancer is diagnosed early and hasn’t spread from the original tumor. Early detection and treatment are critical to a positive outcome. If you think you have symptoms of prostate cancer, you should schedule an appointment with your doctor right away. However, if the cancer advances and spreads outside of your prostate, that will affect your outlook."
1110,Prostate Cancer,Prostate cancer prevention,"There are certainrisk factorsfor prostate cancer, such as age and family history, that you can’t control. However, there are others you can manage. For example,quitting smokingcould reduce your risk of prostate cancer. Diet and exercise are also essential factors that can influence your risk of prostate cancer. Certain foods may help reduce your risk of prostate cancer, such as a diet low in dairy and calcium. Some foods that could lower your risk of prostate cancer include: cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, and kale fish soy oils that contain omega-3 fatty acids, such as olive oil Exercise can likely help reduce your risk of developing advanced prostate cancer and dying of prostate cancer. Exercise can also help you lose weight, and it’s vital because2016 researchhas shown obesity as a risk factor for prostate cancer. With your doctor’s approval, aim for 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week."
1111,Prostate Cancer,Talk with your doctor,"Prostate cancer is a risk for all men as they age, but if it’s caught and treated early, the outlook is generally very good. So as you get older, be sure to have open conversations with your doctor about your risk. If you have any symptoms you think might be prostate cancer, talk to your doctor right away. And even if you don’t have symptoms, consider adopting a healthy lifestyle to decrease your risk."
1112,Psoriasis,Overview,"Psoriasis is a chronic autoimmune condition that speeds up skin cell production, leading to scaly, inflamed patches. It is not contagious. While there is no cure for psoriasis, various treatments, such as topical creams, systemic medications, and light therapy, can help manage symptoms and reduce inflammation. Lifestyle adjustments like stress management, a nutrient-rich diet, and avoiding triggers like alcohol can help you cope with psoriasis and minimize flare-ups. Psoriasis is a chronicautoimmune conditionthat causes the rapid buildup of your skin cells. This buildup of cells causes scaling on your skin’s surface. Inflammation and redness around the scales are fairly common. Typical psoriatic scales are whitish-silver and develop in thick, red patches. However, ondarker skin tones, they can also appear more purplish, dark brown with gray scales. Sometimes, these patches will crack and bleed. Psoriasis is the result of a sped-up skin production process. Typically, skin cells grow deep in your skin and slowly rise to the surface. Eventually, they fall off. The typical life cycle of a skin cell is 1 month. In people with psoriasis, this production process may occur in just a few days. Because of this, skin cells don’t have time to fall off. This rapid overproductionleads tothe buildup of skin cells. According to onestudypublished in 2021, around 7.5 million American adults ages 20 and older have psoriasis — a 3% prevalence rate (occurrence of a condition). By race and ethnicity, the prevalence rates are: 3.6% of white people 3.1% of non-Hispanic people, including multiracial people 2.5% of Asian people 1.9% of Hispanic people, including Mexican American people 1.5% of Black people"
1113,Psoriasis,Where does psoriasis usually start?,"Scales typically develop on joints, such as elbows and knees. However, they may develop anywhere on your body, including the: hands feet neck scalp face Less common types of psoriasis affect the: nails mouth area around the genitals It’s commonly associated with several other conditions, including: type 2 diabetes inflammatory bowel disease heart disease psoriatic arthritis anxiety depression"
1114,Psoriasis,What are the different types of psoriasis?,"There are five types of psoriasis: Plaque psoriasisis the most common type of psoriasis. The American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) estimates thatabout 80–90%of people with the condition have plaque psoriasis. It causes red, inflamed patches on light skin tones and purple or grayish color or darker brown patches on skin of color — making it harder to diagnose in people of color. These patches are often covered with whitish-silver scales or plaques and are oftenmore severe on skin of color. These plaques are commonly found on the elbows, knees, and scalp. Guttate psoriasiscommonlyoccurs in childhood. This type of psoriasis causes small pink or violet spots. The most common sites forguttate psoriasisinclude your torso, arms, and legs. These spots are rarely thick or raised like plaque psoriasis. Pustular psoriasisismore common in adults. It causes white, pus-filledblistersand broad areas of red or violet —depending on skin tone — inflamed skin. It can appear as a more intense violet color on darker skin tones. Pustular psoriasis is typically localized to smaller areas of your body, such as the hands or feet, but it can be widespread. Inverse psoriasiscauses bright areas of red, shiny, inflamed skin. Patches ofinverse psoriasisdevelop under your armpits or breasts, in your groin, or around skinfolds in your genitals. Erythrodermic psoriasisis a severe andvery raretype of psoriasis, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation. This form often covers large sections of your body at once. The skin almost appearssunburned. Scales that develop often slough off in large sections or sheets. It’s not uncommon for you to run a fever or become very ill with this form of psoriasis. This type can be life threatening, so it’s important that you make an appointment with a healthcare professional immediately."
1115,Psoriasis,What are the symptoms of psoriasis?,"Psoriasis symptoms differ from person to person and depend on the type of psoriasis you have. Areas of psoriasis can be as small as a few flakes on your scalp or elbow, or cover the majority of your body. The most common symptoms of plaque psoriasis include: raised, inflamed patches of skin that appear red on light skin and brown or purple on dark skin whitish-silver scales or plaques on the red patches or gray scales on purple and brown patches dry skin that may crack and bleed soreness around patches itching and burning sensations around patches thick, pitted nails painful, swollen joints Not every person will experience all these symptoms. Some people will experience entirely different symptoms if they have a less common type of psoriasis. Most people with psoriasis go through “cycles” of symptoms. The condition may cause severe symptoms for a few days or weeks, and then the symptoms may clear up and be almost unnoticeable. Then, in a few weeks or if made worse by a common psoriasis trigger, the condition may flare up again. Sometimes, symptoms of psoriasis disappear completely. When you have no active signs of the condition, you may be in “remission.” That does not mean psoriasis will not come back, but for this period of time, you’re symptom-free. Psoriasis is not contagious. You cannot pass the skin condition from one person to another. Touching a psoriatic lesion on another person will not cause you to develop the condition. It’s important to be educated on the condition, as many people think psoriasis is contagious."
1116,Psoriasis,What causes psoriasis to start?,"Doctors are unclear as to what causes psoriasis. However, thanks to decades of research, they have a general idea of two key factors: genetics the immune system Psoriasis isan autoimmune condition. Autoimmune conditions are the result of your body attacking itself. In the case of psoriasis,white blood cellsknown as T cells mistakenly attack your skin cells. Generally, in the body, white blood cells are deployed to attack and destroy invading bacteria and mount a defense against infections. This mistaken autoimmune attack causes the skin cell production process to go into overdrive. The sped-up skin cell production causes new skin cells to develop too quickly. They are pushed to the skin’s surface, where they pile up. This results in the plaques that are most commonly associated with psoriasis. The attacks on the skin cells also cause red, inflamed areas of skin to develop. Some people inherit genes that make them more likely to develop psoriasis. If you have an immediate family member with the skin condition, you are at anincreased riskof developing psoriasis, according to research published in 2019. Read more about the causes of psoriasis."
1117,Psoriasis,Diagnosing psoriasis,"Two tests or examinations may be necessary to diagnose psoriasis. Most doctors can make a diagnosis with a simplephysical exam. Symptoms of psoriasis are typically evident and easy to distinguish from other conditions that may cause similar symptoms. During this exam, be sure to show your doctor all areas of concern. In addition, let your doctor know if any family members have the condition. If your symptoms are unclear, or if your doctor wants to confirm their suspected diagnosis, they may take a small sample of your skin. This is known as abiopsy. Biopsies can be done in your doctor’s office on the day of your appointment. Your doctor will likely inject a local numbing medication to make the biopsy less painful. They will then send theskin biopsyto a lab for analysis, where it’ll be examined under a microscope. The examination can diagnose the type of psoriasis you have. It can also rule out other possible disorders or infections. When the results return, your doctor may request an appointment to discuss the findings and treatment options with you. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
1118,Psoriasis,What are the triggers of psoriasis?,"External “triggers” may start a new bout of psoriasis. These triggers are not the same for everyone. They may also change over time for you. The most common triggers for psoriasis include: Unusually high stress may trigger a flare-up. If you learn to reduce andmanage your stress, you can reduce and possibly prevent flare-ups. Alcohol use disordercan trigger psoriasis flare-ups. If you drink excessively, psoriasis outbreaks may be more frequent. Consideringreducing alcohol consumptionor quitting is helpful for more than just your skin. Your doctor can help you create a plan to address your alcohol use concerns if you need assistance. An accident, cut, or scrape may trigger a flare-up. Injections,vaccines, and sunburns can also trigger a new outbreak. Some medications are consideredpsoriasis triggers. These medications include: lithium antimalarial medications high blood pressure medication Psoriasis is caused, at least in part, by the immune system mistakenly attacking healthy skin cells. If you’re sick — maybe you have an infection — your immune systemcan mistakenly buildan immune response against itself in addition to the necessary defense against the infection. This might start another psoriasis flare-up.Strep throatis a common trigger. Here are 10 more psoriasis triggers you can avoid."
1119,Psoriasis,Treatment options for psoriasis,"Psoriasis has no cure. Treatments aim to: reduce inflammation and scales slow the growth of skin cells remove plaques Psoriasis treatments fall into three categories: Creams and ointments applied directly to the skin can be helpful for reducing mild to moderate psoriasis. Topical psoriasis treatments include: topical corticosteroids topical retinoids anthralin vitamin D analogues salicylic acid moisturizer topical JAK inhibitors,such astofacitinib (Xeljanz) People withmoderate to severe psoriasis, and those who have not responded well to other treatment types, may need to use oral or injected medications. Many of these medications can have severe side effects, and for that reason, doctors usually prescribe them for short periods of time. These medications include: methotrexate cyclosporine(Sandimmune) biologics oral retinoids oral apremilast (Otezla)for moderatepsoriasis This psoriasis treatment uses ultraviolet (UV) ornatural light. Sunlight kills the overactive white blood cells that are attacking healthy skin cells and causing the rapid cell growth. Both UVA and UVB light may be helpful in reducing symptoms of mild to moderate psoriasis. Most people with moderate to severe psoriasis will benefit from a combination of treatments. This type of therapy uses more than one of the treatment types to reduce symptoms. Some people may use the same treatment their entire lives. Others may need to change treatments occasionally if their skin stops responding to the treatment they’re receiving. Learn more about your treatment options for psoriasis. If you have moderate to severe psoriasis — or if psoriasis stops responding to other treatments — your doctor may consider an oral or injected medication. The most common oral and injected medications used to treat psoriasis include: This class of medications alters your immune system and prevents interactions between your immune system and inflammatory pathways. These medications are injected or given throughintravenous (IV)infusion. Retinoids reduce skin cell production. Once you stop using them, symptoms of psoriasis will likely return. Side effects includehair lossand mucosal dryness. People who are pregnant or may become pregnant within the next3 yearsshould not take retinoids because of the risk of possiblebirth defectsin unborn children. Cyclosporine(Sandimmune) decreases the immune system’s response. This can ease symptoms of psoriasis. It also means you have a weakened immune system, so you may become sick more easily. Potential side effects includekidney problemsand high blood pressure. Like cyclosporine,methotrexatesuppresses the immune system. It may cause fewer side effects when used in low doses. It can cause serious side effects long term andis not suitableduring pregnancy. Serious side effects includeliver damageand reduced production of red and white blood cells. Learn more about the oral medications used to treat psoriasis."
1120,Psoriasis,Diet recommendations for people with psoriasis,"Food cannot cure or even treat psoriasis, but eating a nutrient-rich diet might help reduce your symptoms. These five lifestyle changes may help ease symptoms of psoriasis and reduce flare-ups: It’s unclear how weight interacts with psoriasis, but losing excess weight may also help in making treatments more effective. If you’re overweight, working toward reachinga moderate weight, may help in reducing the severity of the condition. Reducing your intake ofsaturated fats, which are found in animal products, like meats and dairy, can be helpful in managing psoriasis. It’s also important to increase your intake of lean proteins that contain omega-3 fatty acids, such assalmon,sardines, andshrimp. Plant sources of omega-3s, includingwalnuts,flax seeds, andsoybeans, are also helpful sources, especially if you’re looking for plant-based options. Psoriasis causes inflammation. Certain foods can cause inflammation as well. Avoiding those foods might help improve symptoms. These foods include: red meat refined sugar highly processed foods dairy products Alcohol consumption can increase your risk of a flare-up. Cutting back or quitting entirely can help lower your risk. If you have alcohol use disorder, your doctor can help you create a treatment plan. Some doctors prefer a vitamin-rich diet to vitamins in pill form. However, even the healthiest eater may need help getting adequate nutrients. Ask your doctor if you should be taking any vitamins as a supplement to your diet. Learn more about your dietary options."
1121,Psoriasis,Living with psoriasis,"Having psoriasis can be challenging at times, but with the right approach, you can reduce flare-ups. These three areas will help you cope in the short and long term: Losing any excess weightto reach a moderate weight and eating a nutrient-dense diet can go a long way toward helping ease and reduce symptoms of psoriasis. This includes eating a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids, whole grains, and plants. Also, limiting foods that may increase inflammation in your body is important. These foods include refined sugars, dairy products, and highly processed foods. Speak with your doctor about whether ananti-inflammatory dietis right for you. Stress can be atrigger for psoriasis. Learning to manage and cope with stress may help you reduce flare-ups and ease symptoms. Consider trying the following to helpreduce your stresslevel: meditation journaling breathing yoga People with psoriasis are more likely to experience depression and self-esteem issues, according toresearch. You may feel less confident when new spots appear. Talking with your support network about how psoriasis affects you may be difficult. The constant cycle of the condition may also be frustrating. All emotional issues associated with psoriasis are valid. Connecting with supportive resources is important for handling them. This may include speaking witha mental health professionalor joining a support group for people with psoriasis. Learn more about living with psoriasis."
1122,Psoriasis,Psoriasis and arthritis,"Between 30% and 33% of people with psoriasis will receive a diagnosis of psoriatic arthritis, according torecent clinical guidelinespublished by the AAD and the NPF. This type of arthritis causes swelling, pain, and inflammation in affected joints. It’s commonly mistaken forrheumatoid arthritisorgout. The presence of inflamed, red or purple areas of skin with plaques usually distinguishes this type of arthritis from others. Psoriatic arthritis is a chronic condition. Like psoriasis, thesymptoms of psoriatic arthritismay come and go, alternating between flare-ups and remission. Psoriatic arthritis can also be continuous, with constant symptoms and issues. This condition typically affects joints in the fingers or toes. It may also affect your lower back, wrists, knees, or ankles. Most people who develop psoriatic arthritis have psoriasis. However, it’s possible to develop the joint condition without having a psoriasis diagnosis. Most people who receive an arthritis diagnosis without having psoriasis have a family member who has the skin condition. Treatments for psoriatic arthritis may successfully ease symptoms, relieve pain, and improve joint mobility. As with psoriasis, losing any excess weight, eating a nutrient-rich diet, and avoiding triggers may also help reduce psoriatic arthritis flare-ups. An early diagnosis and treatment plan designed for your specific situation can help reduce the likelihood of severe complications, including joint damage. Learn more about psoriatic arthritis."
1123,Psoriasis,Psoriasis statistics,"Around7.5 millionpeople ages 20 and older in the United States have psoriasis. Psoriasis may begin at any age, but most diagnoses occur in adulthood. The average age of onset is between 15 and 35 years old. Dermnet NZ notes that the risk of developing psoriasis peaks between the ages of16–22 yearsand 50–60 years. These are the ages at which psoriasis is most likely to appear. According to theWHO, males and females are affected equally. Psoriasis is disproportionately diagnosed at a higher rate in white people, but it may be underdiagnosed in people of color because of how it presents on darker skin tones. Having a family member with the conditionincreasesyour risk of developing psoriasis, according to the National Psoriasis Foundation. However, many people with the condition have no family history at all. Some people with a family history will not develop psoriasis. Aroundone-thirdof people with psoriasis will be diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis. In addition, people with psoriasis are more likely to develop conditions such as: type 2 diabetes kidney disease heart disease high blood pressure Though thedata is not complete, somepsoriasis statisticssuggest psoriasis diagnoses are becoming more common. Whether that’s because people are developing the skin condition or doctors are just getting better at diagnosing is unclear."
1124,Psoriasis,Summary,"Psoriasis is a skin condition that results from a faulty immune reaction. Plaque psoriasis — the most common type — causes silvery, scaly lesions that may itch, but other types can appear differently. There is no cure for psoriasis, but a range of at-home remedies and medical treatments can help manage it. Read this article in Spanish."
1125,Psoriatic Arthritis,Overview,"Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) combines joint pain and swelling with psoriasis, affecting up to 30% of people with psoriasis. Symptoms vary and can range from mild to severe, affecting mobility and daily activities. Early diagnosis and treatment are recommended. Treatment for PsA aims to improve symptoms like skin rash and joint inflammation. It uses a combination of medications such as NSAIDs, DMARDs, biologics, and topical treatments, along with lifestyle changes. Lifestyle changes such as exercise, stress relief, and diet can ease PsA symptoms. A balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats can help reduce inflammation and help you maintain a healthy weight, which alleviates pressure on sore joints. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a condition that combines the swollen, sore joints of arthritis with psoriasis. Psoriasis typically causes itchy, scaly, discolored patches to appear on the skin and scalp. About8 million Americanshave psoriasis, and up to30%of these people develop PsA. PsA can be mild or severe and involve one or many joints. If you or a loved one has received a diagnosis of PsA, you may have questions about what life is like with this condition."
1126,Psoriatic Arthritis,What are the symptoms of psoriatic arthritis?,"Symptoms of PsA are different for each person. They can range from mild to severe. Sometimes, your condition will go into remission, and you’ll feel better for a while. Other times, your symptoms may get worse. Your symptoms also depend on the type of PsA you have. General symptoms of PsA include: swollen, tender joints on one or both sides of your body morning stiffness swollen fingers and toes painful muscles and tendons scaly skin patches, which may get worse when joint pain flares up flaky scalp fatigue nail pitting separation of your nail from the nail bed eye redness eye pain (uveitis) SpondylitisPsA, in particular, can also cause the following symptoms: spinal pain and stiffness pain, swelling, and weakness in your:hipskneesanklesfeetelbowhandswristsother joints hips knees ankles feet elbow hands wrists other joints swollen toes or fingers Symmetric PsA affects five or more joints on both sides of your body. Asymmetric PsA affects fewer than five joints, but they can be on opposite sides. Psoriatic arthritis mutilans is a rare form of arthritis that deforms your joints. It can shorten affected fingers and toes. Distal PsA causes pain and swelling in the end joints of your fingers and toes."
1127,Psoriatic Arthritis,What causes psoriatic arthritis?,"In PsA, your immune system attacks your joints and skin. Doctorsdon’t know for surewhat causes these attacks. They think it stems from a combination of genes and environmental factors. PsA runs in families. About40%of people with the condition have one or more relatives with PsA. Something in the environment usually triggers the disease for those with a tendency to develop PsA. That could be a virus, extreme stress, or an injury."
1128,Psoriatic Arthritis,How is psoriatic arthritis treated?,"The goal of PsA treatment is to improve symptoms like skin rash and joint inflammation. Guidelinesreleased in 2018 recommend the “treat-to-target” approach, which is based on a person’s individual preferences. A specific treatment goal and how to measure progress are determined, and then a doctor works with you to select treatments. You have many different treatment options. A typical treatment plan will include one or more of the following: These medications help control joint pain and swelling. Over-the-counter (OTC) options include ibuprofen (Advil) and naproxen (Aleve). If OTC options aren’t effective, your doctor may prescribe NSAIDs in higher doses. If used incorrectly, NSAIDs can cause: stomach irritation stomach bleeding heart attack stroke liver and kidney damage These medications decrease inflammation to prevent joint damage and slow the progression of PsA. They may be administered by various routes, including oral, injection, or infusion. The most commonly prescribed DMARDs include: methotrexate (Trexall) leflunomide (Arava) sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) Apremilast (Otezla) is a newer DMARD that’s taken orally. It works by blocking phosphodiesterase 4, an enzyme involved in inflammation. DMARD side effects include: liver damage bone marrow suppression lung infections There are currentlyfive typesof biologic drugs for treating psoriatic disease. They’re categorized according to what they target and inhibit (block or lessen) in the body: tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors:adalimumab (Humira)certolizumab (Cimzia)golimumab (Simponi)etanercept (Enbrel)infliximab (Remicade) adalimumab (Humira) certolizumab (Cimzia) golimumab (Simponi) etanercept (Enbrel) infliximab (Remicade) interleukin 12 and 23 (IL-12/23) inhibitors:ustekinumab (Stelara) ustekinumab (Stelara) interleukin 17 (IL-17) inhibitorssecukinumab (Cosentyx)ixekizumab (Taltz)brodalumab (Siliq)bimekizumab-bkzx (Bimzelx) secukinumab (Cosentyx) ixekizumab (Taltz) brodalumab (Siliq) bimekizumab-bkzx (Bimzelx) interleukin 23 (IL-23) inhibitorsguselkumab (Tremfya)tildrakizumab-asmn (Ilumya)risankizumab-rzaa (Skyrizi) guselkumab (Tremfya) tildrakizumab-asmn (Ilumya) risankizumab-rzaa (Skyrizi) T-cell inhibitorsabatacept (Orencia) abatacept (Orencia) According tothe treatment guidelinesreleased in November 2018, these medications are recommended as first-line treatments. You receivebiologicsthrough an injection under your skin or as an infusion. Because these medications dampen your immune response, they can increase your risk for serious infections. Other side effects include nausea and diarrhea. These medications can bring down inflammation. For PsA, they’re usually injected into affected joints. Side effects include pain and a slight risk of joint infection. Medications like azathioprine (Imuran) and cyclosporine (Gengraf) calm an overactive immune response, particularly for psoriasis symptoms. They’re not used as often now that TNF-alpha inhibitors are available. Because they weaken the immune response, immunosuppressants can increase your risk for infections. Creams, gels, lotions, and ointments can relieve the itchy PsA rash. These treatments are available over the counter and with a prescription. Options include: anthralin calcitriol or calcipotriene, which are forms ofvitamin D-3 salicylic acid steroid creams tazarotene, which is a derivative of vitamin A Light therapy uses medication, followed by exposure to bright light, to treat psoriasis skin rashes. A few other medications also treat PsA symptoms. These include secukinumab (Cosentyx) and ustekinumab (Stelara). These drugs are injected under your skin. Stelara comes with a warning that it can increase your risk for infections and cancer."
1129,Psoriatic Arthritis,Can lifestyle changes ease psoriatic arthritis symptoms?,"There are things you can do at home to help improve your symptoms: Keeping your joints moving can ease stiffness. Being active for at least 30 minutes per day will also help you lose excess weight and give you more energy. Ask your doctor what type of exercise is safest for your joints. Biking, walking, swimming, and other water exercises are gentler on the joints than high impact exercises like running or playing tennis. Smoking negatively affects your joints as well as the rest of your body. Ask your doctor about counseling, medication, or nicotine replacement to help you quit. Also, it’s best to limit your alcohol intake, as it can interact with some PsA medications. Tension and stress can make arthritis flares even worse. Meditate, practice yoga, or try other stress-relief techniques to calm your mind and body. Warm compresses and hot packs can ease muscle soreness. Cold packs can also reduce pain in your joints. Open doors with your body instead of your fingers. Lift heavy objects with both hands. Use jar openers to open lids. Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties. These healthy fats, found in many supplements, reduce inflammation and stiffness in joints. While research suggests there are health benefits, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn’t monitor the purity or quality of supplements. It’s important to talk with your doctor before you begin taking supplements. Turmeric, a potent spice, also serves up a dose of anti-inflammatory properties and may help reduce inflammation and PsA flare-ups. Turmeric can be added to any dish. Some people even stir it into tea or lattes, like golden milk."
1130,Psoriatic Arthritis,Psoriatic arthritis diet,"While no single food or diet will cure PsA, a nutrient-dense and balanced diet can help reduce inflammation and ease symptoms. Helpful changes to your diet can pay off tremendously for your joints and body in the long run. In short, eat more fresh fruits and vegetables. They help lower inflammation and manage your weight. Excess weight puts more pressure on joints that are already sore. Limit sugar and fat, which are inflammatory. Put an emphasis on sources of healthy fats, like fish, seeds, and nuts."
1131,Psoriatic Arthritis,Types of psoriatic arthritis,"There arefive types of PsA: This type affects the same joints on both sides of your body, so both your left and right knees, for example. Symptoms can be like those of rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Symmetric PsA tends to be milder and causes less joint deformity than RA. But symmetric PsA can be disabling. About40%of people with PsA have this type. This affects a joint or joint on one side of your body. Your joints may feel sore and turn red. Asymmetric PsA is generally mild. The data on its prevalence is mixed, showing that it may affect anywhere between13–65%of people with PsA. This type affects about12%of people with PsA and involves the joints closest to your nails. These are known as the distal joints. This type of PsA involves your spine and affects about 30% of people with PsA. Your entire spine from your neck to your lower back may be affected. This can make movement very painful. Your hands, feet, legs, arms, and hips may also be affected. This is a severe, deforming type of PsA. Somewhere between2–21%of people with PsA have this type, depending on the different definitions of this type across various studies. Psoriatic arthritis mutilans usually affects your hands and feet. It can also cause pain in your neck and lower back."
1132,Psoriatic Arthritis,Psoriatic arthritis stages,"About90%of people who develop PsA have a history of psoriasis. That said, PsA doesn’t follow the same path for each person diagnosed with this condition and may not always begin with skin impact before moving to the joints. Some people may only ever have mild symptoms and limited impact on their joints. For others, joint deformity and bone enlargement may ultimately occur. It’s unclear why some people experience a faster progression of the disease and others don’t. However, early diagnosis and treatment can help ease pain and slow the damage to joints. It’s important you talk with your doctor as soon as you begin experiencing signs or symptoms that hint at PsA. In the initial phases of this arthritis, you may experience mild symptoms like joint swelling and reduced range of motion. These symptoms may happen at the same time you develop psoriasis skin lesions, or they may occur years later. NSAIDs are the typical treatment. These medications ease pain and symptoms, but they don’t slow PsA. Depending on the type of PsA you have, the moderate or middle stage will likely see worsening symptoms that require more progressive treatments, like DMARDs and biologics. These medications can help ease symptoms. They may help slow the progression of damage as well. At this point, bone tissue is heavily affected. Joint deformity and bone enlargement are likely. Treatments aim to ease symptoms and prevent worsening complications."
1133,Psoriatic Arthritis,Diagnosing psoriatic arthritis,"Todiagnose PsA, your doctor has to rule out other causes of arthritis, like RA and gout, with imaging and blood tests. These imaging tests look for damage to joints and other tissues: X-ray:These check for inflammation and damage to bones and joints. This damage is different in PsA than it is in other types of arthritis. MRI:Radio waves and strong magnets make images of the inside of your body. These images can help your doctor check for joint, tendon, or ligament damage. CT scans and ultrasound:These can help doctors determine how advanced PsA is and how badly joints are affected. Blood tests for these substances help assess any inflammation present in your body: C-reactive protein:This is a substance your liver produces when there’s inflammation in your body. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate:This reveals how much inflammation is in your body. But it can’t determine whether the inflammation is from PsA or other possible causes. Rheumatoid factor (RF):Your immune system produces this autoantibody. It’s usually present in RA but negative in PsA. An RF blood test can help your doctor tell whether you have PsA or RA. Joint fluid:An arthrocentesis removes a small amount of liquid from your knee or other joint. If uric acid crystals are in the fluid, you might have gout instead of PsA. A culture fluid test can rule out infection or sepsis. Red blood cells:A low red blood cell count from anemia is common in people with PsA. No single blood or imaging test can determine if you have PsA. Your doctor uses a combination of tests to rule out other possible causes."
1134,Psoriatic Arthritis,Risk factors for psoriatic arthritis,"You’re more likely to get PsA if you: have psoriasis have a parent or sibling with PsA are between theages of 30–50(though children can get it, too) have had strep throat have HIV"
1135,Psoriatic Arthritis,What can trigger a psoriatic arthritis flare-up?,"PsA flare-ups make the condition worse for a period of time. Certain things can set off PsA flares. Everyone’s triggers are different. To learn your triggers, keep a symptom diary. Each day, write down your symptoms and what you were doing when they started. Also note whether you changed anything in your routine, like if you started taking a new medication. Common PsA triggersinclude: infections, like strep throat and upper respiratory infections injuries, like a cut, scrape, or sunburn dry skin stress cold, dry weather smoking excessive alcohol intake stress excess weight some medications, like lithium, beta-blockers, and antimalarial drugs Although you can’t avoid all of these triggers, you can try to manage stress, stop smoking, and cut down your alcohol intake. Ask your doctor if you take any medications known to set off PsA symptoms. If so, you might want to switch to a new drug."
1136,Psoriatic Arthritis,Frequently asked questions,"Although psoriatic arthritis or fibromyalgiacan occur together, they are different conditions. Psoriatic arthritis is an immune-mediated inflammatory condition, whereas fibromyalgia causes widespread musculoskeletal pain without inflammation. It’s also associated with tiredness and cognitive difficulties similar to PsA but has unique underlying causes. For this reason, the symptoms can overlap, and it may be hard to tell the difference between the two without a proper diagnosis from a doctor. There isn’t one part of the body where PsA starts because it develops and progresses differently in each person. It may start in the skin, especially in people who already have psoriasis, but may also begin in the joints. PsA puts you at risk forcomplicationssuch as: psoriatic arthritis mutilans eye problems, like conjunctivitis or uveitis cardiovascular disease sacroiliitis,which is the inflammation of the sacroiliac joint (SI) depression As PsA is an autoimmune disease, it cannot be prevented. That said, there arestrategies to prevent or reduce flare-ups, and manage the symptoms. This includes avoiding known triggers."
1137,Psoriatic Arthritis,Outlook,"Everyone’s outlook is different. Some people have very mild symptoms that only cause problems from time to time. Others have more severe and debilitating symptoms. The more severe your symptoms are, the more PsA will affect your ability to get around. People with a lot of joint damage may find it hard to walk, climb stairs, and do other daily activities. Your outlook will be affected if: you received a diagnosis of PsA at a young age. your condition was severe when you got your diagnosis. a lot of your skin is covered in rashes. a few people in your family have PsA. To improve your outlook, follow the treatment regimen your doctor prescribes. You might have to try more than one drug to find what works best for you. Read this article in Spanish."
1138,Psychotherapy,What is psychotherapy?,"Psychotherapy is sometimes called talk therapy because it’s based on conversations you have with a trained psychotherapist, psychiatrist, therapist, or counselor. In a confidential setting, you and your therapist discuss parts of your life that you’d like to improve. But, talking is simply an avenue to discuss a large array of experiences, in an effort to be able to learn more from them. Depending on your therapist, the type of therapy, and your own needs, you might talk about your: personal history emotions relationships thought patterns behaviors and habits goals and obstacles Several different types ofmental health professionalsprovide psychotherapy, including: licensed professional counselors social workers marriage and family therapists developmental orchild psychologists psychoanalysts psychiatrists or psychiatric nurses psychotherapists"
1139,Psychotherapy,Types of psychotherapy,"The field of psychotherapy is constantly evolving, and now can be done either in person or online. There are also a variety of different types to choose from, in order to fit with your specific needs. These can include: individual therapy couples therapy group therapy family therapy If you’re trying group therapy, expect to share speaking and listening space with several other people. Many groups are organized around a common experience, such as survivingdomestic violenceorsubstance use. In most cases, you’ll have something in common with the other people in the group. Group therapy also requires confidentiality, so you won’t be able to discuss what you hear in the session once you leave. Different psychotherapies can be available to both children and adults, and sessions can range from a few weeks to a few years depending on your personal goals."
1140,Psychotherapy,Psychotherapy techniques,"Your therapist may use methods ortechniquesfrom different approaches to tailor therapy to your needs. In addition, some therapists specialize in certain modalities, such as art, play, or animal therapies. These psychotherapy techniques may include: The goal ofcognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)is to identify and change patterns you have that may be harmful, or simply unhelpful to you. By identifying these patterns or behaviors, you and your therapist will work together in order to create more effective and helpful ones. This type of psychotherapy can be beneficial for those who struggle with depression, anxiety, or trauma-related disorders. Through CBT, it may be easier for you to recognize current problems that exist for you, as well as give you the tools to deal with them in an appropriate and effective way. A type of CBT, this therapy technique is most commonly used for those with suicidal thoughts, borderline personality disorder, eating disorders, orpost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It’s meant to help you process and regulate your emotions, a method that’s not as emphasized in traditional CBT. The goal is to tackle these emotions and teach new skills that will help each person take responsibility for unhealthy and negative behavior. It’s often done through individual and group therapy. This form of psychotherapy focuses on helping you with underlying personal issues that may be affecting your social, personal, or professional life. In some cases, this can pertain to unresolved grief, sudden changes in your everyday life, or conflicts with loved ones and peers. The goal of this therapy is to create healthy communication skills and learn how you can relate them to resolving burdens and conflicts. It’s one of the most common therapy methods in treatingdepression. Thistherapy techniqueattempts to draw on past events, such as from your childhood, to see how they might be influencing negative behaviors or patterns you exhibit today in both physical and mental health. Through this technique, you’ll work with your therapist to become more self-aware of these patterns and change them. The goal is to let go of the influence of your past and take more control over your current life. Based on the theories of Sigmund Freud, this therapy examines your subconscious motivations or desires and how they may be influencing your relationships, actions, or thoughts. By examining these subconscious ideas, your therapist will help you become more self-aware of them and change them to promote healthy functioning and healing. This is typically thought of as a more intensive form of psychodynamic therapy, and sessions are usually conducted a few times a week. This technique aims to help you develop your own resources through encouragement and guidance. It’s helpful in increasing self-esteem, bolstering coping mechanisms, reducing anxiety, and improving social functioning."
1141,Psychotherapy,Who can benefit from psychotherapy,"Psychotherapy is effective for treating a wide variety of mental health and behavioral issues, including: depression anxiety substance use disorders eating disorders trauma recovery, including PTSD griefor loss relationship problems stress low self-esteem major life transitions (change in personal life or career) mental health disorders Psychotherapy works best when you’re open to sharing your thoughts and feelings with a therapist. It’s key that there’s trust between you and your therapist. However, the most important thing to keep in mind is that psychotherapy takes time. Forming a bond with your therapist won’t happen overnight, and changing the thoughts and behaviors that aren’t working for you is a gradual process. Some mental health issues may be best treated with medication. If you’re considering psychotherapy, talk with a healthcare professional to see if a blended approach, including medication andtalk therapy, will benefit you most."
1142,Psychotherapy,What to expect,"When starting psychotherapy, there are a few steps to the process. During your first visit, your therapist will likely talk with you about your background and what brought you to therapy. This way, you and your therapist will be able to get to know each other a little better and possibly start to build some trust. However, this can be a lengthy process for some people. Therapy sessions are confidential, so your therapist won’t be able to discuss what you share, except in strictly limited legal situations or to protect your life or someone else’s life. In later sessions, you’ll typically discuss what you want to accomplish with therapy. From there, once some trust is built, you’ll begin discussing deeper issues — the ones that you’re holding back, holding you back from functioning, or causing you pain. Your therapist may suggest some homework for you to complete between sessions. And you may learn strategies to use to improve yourmood, communication skills, thought patterns, or behaviors. How long your therapy continues can depend on both your personal needs as well as the specific therapy technique. In some cases ofIPT, it may be shorter-term as long as you and your therapist both believe you’ve been able to understand the underlying issues that have been causing problems. In cases ofpsychoanalysis, sessions are typically more intensive and sessions can be conducted three or more times a week for an extended period of time. For some people, the relationship with a therapist is supportive, and they continue in therapy for months or years. For others, it’s important to target a problem and resolve it as soon as possible. Ultimately, the decision for how long you continue therapy can be a personal decision."
1143,Psychotherapy,Benefits of psychotherapy,"Decades ofresearchhave shown that evidence-based psychotherapy can be an effective way to treat a wide variety of concerns, includingdepression, anxiety, grief,addiction, and trauma recovery. A2018 studyfound that veterans with PTSD benefited greatly in recovery by going through techniques, such as trauma-focused CBT. In some cases, it may be recommended as first-line treatment for PTSD. It’s also effective in changing unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors, including those that lead to substance use disorders. A2021 studyfound that CBT was an impressive treatment option in helping those withinternet addictionbecome aware of their patterns, change them, and better their lifestyle and mental health as a result."

1148,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Overview,"Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune condition that can cause pain, swelling, and stiffness in the joints. Though there is no cure, early diagnosis and treatment can help manage symptoms and prevent permanent joint damage. Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is anautoimmune diseasethat can cause joint pain, inflammation, and damage throughout your body. The joint damage that RA causes usually happens on both sides of the body. So, if a joint is affected in one of your arms or legs, the same joint in the other arm or leg will probably be affected, too. This is one way that doctors distinguish RA from otherforms of arthritis, such asosteoarthritis (OA). Treatments work best when RA is diagnosed early, so it’s important to learn the signs. Read on to learn everything you want to know about RA, from types and symptoms to home remedies, diets, and other treatments."
1149,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Types of rheumatoid arthritis,"There are several differenttypes of RA. Knowing which type you have may help your healthcare professional choose the best type of treatment for you. The types of RA include: Seropositive RA:This is themost commontype of RA. This type of arthritis may run in families. Seropositive RA may come with more severe symptoms than seronegative RA. Seronegative RA:This means you’ve tested negative for bothrheumatoid factor (RF)and a type of antibody called cyclic citrullinated peptides (CCP), but you’re still experiencing RA symptoms. Juvenile idiopathic arthritis(JIA):As the name suggests, this is a form of RA in children. The prevalence varies depending on the research and has been found to be as high as3.8 to 400 casesper 100,000 children."
1150,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis symptoms,"RA is a chronic disease marked by inflammation and pain in the joints. These symptoms and signs increase during periods known asflaresor exacerbations. Other times are known as periods ofremission, which is when symptoms can disappear completely. RA symptomscommonly affectjoints in thehands,wrists, and knees but can also affect tissues and organs throughout the body, including the lungs, heart, and eyes. Symptoms can include stiffness, tenderness, swelling, and pain in more than one joint, among othernon-joint-related symptoms. These symptoms can vary from mild to severe. It’s important not to ignore your symptoms, even if they come and go. Knowing theearly signs of RAwill help you and your healthcare professional better treat and manage it.

1151,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Causes and risk factors for rheumatoid arthritis,"RA is an autoimmune disorder where the immune system attacks healthy body tissues, causing inflammation and damage to the joints and sometimes to other body systems. RA has someknown triggers. If left untreated, the joint can become damaged, lose its shape and alignment, and ultimately be destroyed. A number of genetic and environmental factorsmay increaseyour chance of developing rheumatoid arthritis. Though it can affect anyone at any age, the chance of developing rheumatoid arthritisincreaseswith older age. Females assigned at birth (FAABs) are likelier to develop it than males assigned at birth (MAABs). Researchers believe that reproductive and hormonal factors may contribute to the development of this disease in females Otherrisk factorsinclude genetics, smoking, obesity, and diet.

1152,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Rheumatoid arthritis diagnosis,"Diagnosing RA can take time and may require multiple lab tests to confirm clinical examination findings. Your healthcare professional will use several tools to diagnose RA. First, they’ll ask about your symptoms and medical history. They’ll also perform a physical exam of your joints, in which they will look for symptoms like swelling or issues with reflexes or joint function. If they suspect RA, they’ll most likely refer you to a specialist called arheumatologist. Since no single test can confirm a diagnosis of RA, your healthcare professional or rheumatologistmay useseveral different types of tests. These include blood draws testing for antibodies or other substances elevated during inflammatory conditions. They may also send you for certain imaging tests, such as anultrasound,X-ray, orMRI, ti see if joint damage has occurred and how severe it might be. A complete evaluation and monitoring of other organ systems might be recommended for some people with RA, too.

Decreasing the inflammation can also help to prevent further joint and organ damage. Treat to Target, a treatment philosophy that rheumatologists use to effectively manage RA, hasresultedin fewer symptoms and higher remission rates for those with RA. It involves: setting a specific testing goal that signals either remission or low disease state testing acute phase reactants and performing monthly monitoring to assess the progress of treatment and management plan switching medication regimen promptly if progress isn’t made In addition, certainalternative treatments,home remedies, and lifestyle adjustmentsmay helpimprove one’s quality of life when living with RA. These include specific types ofexercise, rest, andassistive devices. Particularly, your doctor or dietitian may recommend ananti-inflammatory dietto help with your symptoms.

Some environmental causes such as hormones, stress, or infection are also thought to be triggers. Rheumatoid arthritis can cause a variety of symptoms that may come and go in intensity. These periods of increased disease activity or flare are often followed by times of relief or remission when swelling and pain decrease or go away entirely."
1156,Rheumatoid Arthritis,Talk with your healthcare professional,"RA is a chronic disease that doesn’t currently have a cure. That said, most people with RA don’t have constant symptoms. Instead, they have flare-ups followed by relatively symptom-free periods called remissions. The course of the disease varies from person to person, and symptoms can range from mild to severe. Though symptoms may stop for extended periods, joint problems caused by RA will usually get worse over time. That’s why early treatment is so important to help delay serious joint damage. If you’re experiencing any symptoms or have concerns about RA, talk to your healthcare provider. Read this article in Spanish."
1157,Seizures,Overview,"A seizure is a sudden change in movement or awareness due to a change in the electrical function of the brain. Sudden bursts of electrical energy may affect movement, sensation and consciousness. Seizures are changes in the brain’s electrical activity. These changes can cause dramatic, noticeable symptoms, subtle or mild symptoms, or no symptoms at all. The symptoms of a major seizure include repetitive jerking and stiffening and a loss of control. Because some seizures can lead to injury or be a sign of an underlying medical condition, it’s important to seek treatment if you experience them."
1158,Seizures,What are the types of seizures?,"One way of classifying seizures is based on where they start in the brain. According to this classification method, seizure types include focal onset seizures, generalized onset seizures, and unknown onset seizures. Focal onset seizuresbegin in only one area of the brain. Some people may also refer to these as partial seizures. Focal onset seizures start in small areas of the brain—such as the area that controls leg movement on one side of the body—and can sometimes spread throughout the hemisphere (one side of the brain) or even to the other side of the brain. Medical professionals typically define focal onset seizures into two types: focal aware seizures and focal awareness-impaired seizures. During a focal aware seizure, you’ll remain conscious and be aware that something is happening, even if you don’t recognize it as a seizure. The symptoms of a focal aware seizure willdependon which part of the brain the seizure starts. Focal aware seizures may occur briefly, but can also spread to cause a focal impaired-awareness seizure or a secondarily generalized seizure. Often, when a focal awareness seizure precedes a more widespread seizure, this early stage is defined as a warning or an aura. This type of seizureaffectsyour consciousness. During a focal impaired-awareness seizure, you may not be able to move, talk, or hear as you did before. You may also not be able to remember the event. Focal impaired-awareness seizures can last for up to2 minutes. This type of seizure typically affects areas of the brain that affect your awareness. These seizures start in both sides of the brain simultaneously. Among the more common types of generalized onset seizures are: Tonic:Tonic seizures will result in your muscles stiffening up. Clonic:The convulsions in clonic seizures may cause abnormal, jerky movements of your limbs. You will likely lose consciousness during these seizures that can last for a few minutes. Tonic-clonic:Tonic-clonic seizuresinclude a combination of both tonic and clonic symptoms. Myoclonic:During a myoclonic seizure, you may experience sudden muscle spasms. These are typically too short-lived to affect consciousness and pass quickly. Myoclonic seizures may be of generalized onset as well as focal onset. Absence:People may also refer to these as petit mal seizures.Absence seizureslast for only a few seconds. They can cause you to blink repeatedly or stare into space. Other people may mistakenly think you’re daydreaming. Atonic:Duringatonic seizuresyour muscles suddenly go limp. Your head may nod, or your entire body could fall to the ground. Atonic seizures are brief, lasting about 15 seconds. People may refer to these seizures as drop attacks. Sometimes no one witnesses the beginning of a seizure. For example, someone may wake up in the middle of the night and observe their partner having a seizure."
1159,Seizures,What are the symptoms of a seizure?,"It’s possible to have an epilepsy condition that causes both focal and generalized seizures at different times, but not simultaneously. A focal seizure can progress to become a generalized seizure. Sometimes this happens slowly and sometimes it can happen rapidly. Sometimes warning symptoms occur before the seizure takes place. These can include: a sudden feeling of fear oranxiousness a feeling of being sick to your stomach dizziness a change in vision a jerky movement of the arms and legs that may cause you to drop things an out-of-body sensation aheadache déjà vu mood changes Signs that indicate a seizure is in progress include: losing consciousness, followed by confusion having uncontrollable muscle spasms drooling or frothing at the mouth falling having a strange taste in your mouth clenching your teeth biting your tongue having sudden,rapid eye movements making unusual noises, such as grunting losing control of bladder or bowel function"
1160,Seizures,What causes seizures?,"Seizures can stem from several health conditions. Some examples include: alcohol withdrawal brain infection, such asmeningitis brain injury during childbirth brain irregularity present at birth choking illegal drug use illegal drug withdrawal electrolyteimbalance electric shock epilepsy extremelyhigh blood pressure fever head trauma kidneyorliver failure low blood glucose levels stroke brain tumor vascular abnormality in the brain Seizures can run in families. Tell your doctor if you or anyone in your family has a history of seizures. In some instances, especially with young children, the cause of the seizure may be unknown."
1161,Seizures,What are the effects of seizures?,"Living with epilepsy and experiencing repeated seizures can have both short- and long-term effects. These can range from a drop in quality of life to increased risks of mental health conditions. Some seizures can cause you to lose total control of your body. This can lead to falls and other movements that can result in injury. Epilepsyincreasesthe risk of injuries, such as bruises or fractures. Being prone to seizures may also affect your quality of life. For example, you may no longer be able to drive. You may want to avoid situations where a seizure could cause serious harm, such as swimming or traveling alone. It’s important to wear a medical identification bracelet that tells emergency responders that you have epilepsy. If you have epilepsy, treatment is important to prevent future seizures and worsening epilepsy. And a prolonged seizure episode can be dangerous if it’s not treated. Whiledeathas a direct result of seizures is rare, the risk of premature death in people with epilepsy is up tothree times higherthan in the general population. Living with epilepsy can have an impact on your mental health. People living with epilepsymay becomedepressed or anxious due to the worry of having a seizure. You may also feel isolated, be worried about getting hurt or experience stigma. The changes in the brain that can cause epilepsy may be associated with the different brain changes that can cause psychiatric conditions,such asbipolar disorder, schizophrenia and severe depression."
1162,Seizures,How are seizures diagnosed?,"Your doctor may recommend specific tests to accurately diagnose a seizure and help ensure that treatments will be effective. They will consider your complete medical history and the events leading up to the seizure. For example,migraine, headaches,sleep disorders, and extreme psychological stress can cause symptoms that may seem like seizures. Lab tests may help your doctor rule out other conditions that may be considered during your diagnostic evaluation. The tests may include: blood testing to check for electrolyte imbalances spinal tapto rule out infection toxicology screening to test for drugs, poisons, or toxins Anelectroencephalogram (EEG)can help your doctor diagnose a seizure. This test measures your brain waves. Viewing brain waves during a seizure can help a doctor diagnose the type of seizure. An EEG can show evidence of seizure activity even when you aren’t having a seizure. Imaging scans, such as aCTorMRI, can also help by providing a clear picture of the brain. These scans allow your doctor to see abnormalities like brain damage or a tumor, which can trigger seizures."
1163,Seizures,How are seizures treated?,"Treatments for seizures depend on the cause. By treating the cause of the seizures, you may be able topreventfuture seizures from occurring. The treatment for seizures due to epilepsy include: Antiepileptic drugsare often the first treatment option for people experiencing multiple seizures. They target the signaling activities in specific brain cells and can effectively control seizures in approximately70%of cases. There are several types of antiepileptic drugs. You and your doctor may have to work to find out which is the best medication for treating your condition. Doctors may recommendsurgical optionsfor treating epilepsy and seizures if you have a seizure focus or a growth that needs to be removed. Surgical procedures to treat epilepsy include: resective surgery multiple subpial transection hemispherectomy corpus callosotomy Brain surgery for epilepsy can improve quality of life but does carry a risk of complications. Consult with your doctor to discuss whether surgery is the right option for you. In addition to brain surgery, surgeons can insert nerve stimulation devices in the body to treat epilepsy. Vagus nerve stimulationinvolvesplacing electrodes around thevagus nervein your neck and a generator for these electrodes in the upper chest. These devices then stimulate the nerve with electrical signals, which can help manage seizures. Responsive neurostimulation systems also work by stimulating the brain to manage seizures. Doctors can program these devices to assess and respond to nerve activity associated with seizures, often stopping them. These less invasive surgical options canhelpsafely reduce seizure frequency and severity. Doctors may also suggestdeep brain stimulationtherapy. This is where a surgeon places electrodes onto thethalamus. The thalamus is a part of the brain that processes signals from almost every sensory system. It regulates consciousness, alertness, and sleep cycles. Electrical signals from these electrodeshelp regulatethe excitability of certain parts of the brain. This can help reduce the frequency of seizures. These techniques only work for certain seizure types, and pre-surgical testing can help determine whether you would benefit from electrical stimulation device implantation. Following aketogenic dietmay be an alternative to surgery for some people living with epilepsy. Multiple studieshave linked the diet to positive outcomes in symptom management. However, the ketogenic diet and its variants can feel restrictive. Following the diet long term may be challenging for some. Be sure to check with your doctor before starting a new diet, especially as a mode of treatment."
1164,Seizures,Tips for living with epilepsy,"It can be challenging to live with epilepsy. But if you have the right support, it’s possible to live a full and healthy life. It’s important to continue taking antiepileptic drugs if your doctor prescribes them. It’s important to regularly check in with your doctor and tell them whether you’re experiencing any side effects of your medications. If you have your seizures under control for long periods, your doctormay recommenda gradual reduction in dosage. Some people may be able to identify specific triggers for their seizures. These can include: stress drinking alcohol lack of sleep Avoiding these triggers may help youmanageyour condition. Teach your friends and family more about epilepsy and how to care for you while a seizure occurs. This includes taking steps to reduce the risk of injury like cushioning your head, loosening tight clothing, and turning you on your side if vomiting occurs. Continue your usual activities if possible, and find ways to work around your epilepsy so you can maintain your lifestyle. For instance, if you’re no longer allowed to drive because you have seizures, you may decide to move to an area that’s walkable or has good public transportation, or use ride-share services so you can still get around. Making safety modifications to your place of residencecan reduce the riskof injury. This can include covering the corners of low objects, not locking the bathroom door when using it, and using guards on radiators and heaters. Find a doctor who makes you feel comfortable. Try relaxation techniques, such asyoga,meditation,tai chi, ordeep breathing. Find an epilepsy support group. You can find a local one by looking online or asking your doctor for recommendations."
1165,Seizures,Prevention,"In many instances, a seizure isn’t preventable. But maintaining a healthy lifestyle can give you the best chance at reducing your risk. You can try: gettingplenty of sleep eating abalanced dietand drinking plenty of fluids exercising regularly engage in stress-reducing techniques avoiding illegal drugs If you’re on medication for epilepsy or other medical conditions, take them as your doctor prescribes."
1166,Seizures,"How to help a person with epilepsy, or a person having a seizure","If you live with someone with epilepsy, there are some things you can do to help them: learning about their condition. making a list of their medications, doctors’ appointments, and other important medical information speaking with the person about their condition and what role they would like you to play in helping If you need help, reach out to their doctor or an epilepsy support group. TheEpilepsy Foundationis a helpful resource. However, it’s important to note that the foundation is an advocacy group, and may maintain bias on specific topics. If someone near you is having a seizure, there are a number of things you can do to help them. Clear the area around a person who’s having a seizure to prevent possible injury. If possible, place them on their side and provide cushioning for their head. Stay with the person. Call 911 or local emergency services as soon as possible if the person is pregnant or has never had a seizure before, or if they experience any of the following: a seizure that lasts longer than 5 minutes doesn’t wake up after the seizure repeat seizures It’s important to remain calm. While there’s no way to stop a seizure once it’s begun, you can provide help. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)recommends: stay with the person having the seizure until it ends, or until they’re fully awake checking to see whether the person is wearing a medical bracelet removing their glasses or anything around their neck holding them in a hug or gently guiding them to the floor if they are standing positioning them on their sideif they are on the ground so that saliva or vomit leaks out of their mouth instead of down their windpipe placing something soft under their head notholding the person down while they’re having a seizure notputting anything in the person’s mouth Once a seizure is over, you should: check the person for injuries turn the person on their side, if not already stay with them until they’re fully awake and alert provide them with a safe area to rest not offer them anything to eat or drink until they’re fully conscious"
1167,Seizures,When to see a doctor,"Typically, a seizure doesn’t require emergency medical attention. However, there are some circumstances when you shouldcall 911 or emergency services: This is the first time the person has ever had a seizure. The seizure continues for more than 5 minutes. The person is having difficulty with breathing. The person is having trouble waking following the seizure. The person is injured during the seizure. The seizure occurs in water. The person is pregnant, has diabetes or heart disease. A second seizure happens soon after the first."
1168,Shingles,Overview,"Shingles is caused by the same virus as chickenpox and may be triggered by a weakened immune system, stress, or other health conditions. Symptoms of shingles may include a painful rash, fever, chills, headache, and fatigue, and could lead to complications like vision problems or Ramsay Hunt syndrome. Early treatment with antiviral medications can help speed up recovery, reduce symptom severity, and lower the risk of complications. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that adults over 50 receive the Shingrix vaccine to prevent shingles."
1169,Shingles,What is shingles?,"Shingles is an infection caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which is the same virus that causes chickenpox. Even after the chickenpox infection is over, the virus remains dormant or inactive in your nervous system for years before reactivating as shingles. Shingles is also referred to as herpes zoster. This type of viral infection is characterized by a red skin rash that can cause pain and burning. Shingles usually appears as astripe of blisterson one side of the body, typically on the torso, neck, or face. Most cases of shingles clear up within 3 to 5 weeks. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately one in three people in the United States will have shingles at some point in their life. The condition can occur in the same person more than once, especially if they have risk factors, but this is uncommon. Keep reading to learn more about shingles, including symptoms, treatments, and complications."
1170,Shingles,Symptoms of shingles,"Thefirst symptoms of shinglesare usually pain and burning, according to theCDC. The pain is typically on one side of your body, and along a certain area of the skin called adermatome. A redrashoften follows. However, the rash does not always appear red. Depending on skin tone, the rash can appear dark pink, dark brown, or purplish. TheNational Institute on Aging (NIA)says that characterizations of a shingles rash include: rash that appears on one side of the body, such as on the chest, abdomen, back, or face a rash on your face and ears itchiness fluid-filled blisters that break easily burning sensation Some people with shingles experience symptoms beyond pain and rash. According to theAmerican Academy of Dermatology, these symptoms may include: fever chills headache fatigue muscle weakness Rare and seriouscomplicationsof shingles include: pain or rashthat involves an eye, which should be treated immediately to avoid permanent eye damage loss of hearingorintense pain in one ear,dizziness, orloss of tasteon your tongue, which can be symptoms ofRamsay Hunt syndromeand also require immediate treatment bacterial infectioncharacterized by skin that’s red, swollen, or warm to the touch Shingles usually occurs on one side of your back or chest, but you can also get a rash onone side of your face. If the rash is close to or in your ear, it can cause aninfectionthat could lead to: loss of hearing issues with your balance weakness in your facial muscles Shingles inside your mouth can be very painful. It may be difficult to eat and may affect your sense of taste. A shingles rash on your scalp can cause sensitivity when you comb or brush your hair. Without treatment,shingles on the scalpcan lead to permanent bald patches. For some people, shingles occurs in and aroundthe eye. This is referred to as ophthalmic herpes zoster or herpes zoster ophthalmicus. A blistering rash may appear on your eyelids, forehead, and sometimes the tip or side of your nose. You may experience symptoms like: burning or throbbing in your eye redness and tearing swelling blurred vision After the rash disappears, you may still have pain in your eye due to nerve damage. The pain eventually gets better for most people. Without treatment, shingles of the eyecan leadto serious problems, including long-termvision lossand permanent scarring due to swelling of the cornea. If you suspect you have shingles in and around your eye, contact a doctor right away. While shingles rashes usually develop around one side of your waistline, a stripe of blisters may appear along one side of your back or lower back. You can get a shingles rash onyour buttocks. Shingles usually only affects one side of your body, so you may have a rash on one buttock but not the other. As with other areas of the body,shingles on your buttocksmay cause initial symptoms like tingling, itching, or pain. After a few days, a red rash or blisters may develop. Some people experience pain but don’t develop a rash."
1171,Shingles,Stages of shingles,"According to the NIA, most shingles cases last from3 to 5 weeks. After the varicella-zoster virus initially reactivates, your skin may: tingle burn feel numb itch Shingles usually develops on one side of your body, often on your waist, back, or chest. Within about 5 days, you may see a red rash in that area. Small groups of oozing, fluid-filled blisters may appear a few days later in the same area. You may experience flu-like symptoms such as a fever, headache, or fatigue. During the next 10 days or so, the blisters will dry up and form scabs. The scabs will clear after a couple of weeks. After the scabs clear, some people continue to experience pain. This is calledpostherpetic neuralgia."
1172,Shingles,Shingles causes,"Shingles is caused by the varicella-zoster virus, which also causeschickenpox. If you’ve already had chickenpox, you can develop shingles when this virus reactivates in your body. The reason why shingles develop in some people but not others is unclear. It’s more common in older adults because of lower immunity to infections. Possiblerisk factorsfor shingles include: a weakened immune system emotional stress aging undergoing cancer treatments or major surgery"
1173,Shingles,Can you get shingles from the vaccine?,"One vaccine called Shingrix is currently approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to prevent shingles. TheCDCrecommends adults over 50 years old receive two doses of Shingrix separated by 2 to 6 months. The vaccine is over 90-percent effective. Whileside effectssuch as allergic reactions are possible from the vaccine, they are rare. And the CDC has no documented cases of the varicella-zoster virus being transmitted from people who were vaccinated."
1174,Shingles,Who’s at risk for shingles?,"Shingles can occur in anyone who has had chickenpox. However, certain factors put people at an increased risk of developing shingles. According to theNIA, these include: being 60 years or older having conditions that weaken your immune system, such asHIVorcancer having hadchemotherapyorradiation treatment taking medications that weaken your immune system, such as steroids or medications given after an organ transplant having had shingles before"
1175,Shingles,Can you catch shingles from someone?,"According to theNational Health Service, shingles is not contagious. But the varicella-zoster virus that causes it can be spread to another person who hasn’t hadchickenpox, and they could develop chickenpox. You can’t get shingles from someone with shingles, but you can get chickenpox. The varicella-zoster virus is spread when someone comes into contact with an oozing blister. It’s not contagious if the blisters are covered or have formed scabs. To prevent the varicella-zoster virus from spreading if you have shingles, be sure to keep the rash clean and covered. Do not touch the blisters, and make sure to wash your hands often. Avoid being around at-risk people, such as people who are pregnant or have weak immune systems."
1176,Shingles,When to contact a doctor,"It’s important to visit your doctor as soon as possible if you suspect you have shingles, especially if you’re somebody at an increased risk of developing it. TheAmerican Academy of Dermatologyrecommends visiting a dermatologist or other healthcare professional within 3 days to prevent long-term complications. Shingles typically clears up within a few weeks and does not commonly recur. If your symptoms have not lessened within 10 days, contact a doctor for a follow-up and reevaluation. If you need help finding a primary care doctor, then check out our FindCare tool here."
1177,Shingles,Shingles diagnosis,"Doctors usually diagnose shingles by examining your rashes and blisters. They also ask questions about your medical history. In rare instances, your doctor may need to test a sample of your skin or the fluid from your blisters. This involves using a sterile swab to collect a sample of tissue or fluid. Samples are then sent to a medical laboratory to confirm the presence of the virus."
1178,Shingles,Shingles treatment,"There’s no cure for shingles, but treating it as soon as possible can help prevent complications and speed up your recovery. Ideally, you should receive treatment within72 hoursof developing symptoms. Your doctor may prescribe medications to ease symptoms and shorten the length of the infection. The medications prescribed to treat shingles vary, but may include the following: Type Purpose Drug frequency Method antiviral medications, including acyclovir, valacyclovir, and famciclovir to reduce pain and speed recovery 2 to 5 times daily, as prescribed by your doctor oral anti-inflammatory drugs, including ibuprofen to ease pain and swelling every 6 to 8 hours oral narcotic medications or pain relievers to reduce pain likely to be prescribed once or twice daily oral anticonvulsants or tricyclic antidepressants to treat prolonged pain once or twice daily oral antihistamines, such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) to treat itching every 8 hours oral numbing creams, gels, or patches, such as lidocaine to reduce pain applied as needed topical capsaicin (Zostrix) to help reduce the risk of a nerve pain called postherpetic neuralgia, which occurs after recovery from shingles applied as needed topical"
1179,Shingles,Shingles home remedies,"Home treatmentcan help ease your shingles symptoms. According to theNIA, these remedies include: taking cool baths or showers to clean and soothe your skin applying wetcold compressesto the rash to reduce pain and itching applyingcalamine lotionor making a paste with water and baking soda or cornstarch to reduce itching eating foods withvitamin A,vitamin B12,vitamin C, andvitamin E takingL-lysine supplementsto strengthen your immune system"
1180,Shingles,How to prevent shingles,"TheNIAsays that getting vaccinated can help keep you from developing severe shingles symptoms or complications. All children should receive two doses of thechickenpox vaccine, also known as a varicella immunization. Adults who’ve never had chickenpox should also get this vaccine. The immunization doesn’t necessarily mean that you won’t get chickenpox, but it does prevent it in 9 out of 10 people who get the vaccine. Adults who are50 years or oldershould get a shingles vaccine, also known as the varicella-zoster immunization, according to the CDC. This vaccine helps to prevent severe symptoms and complications associated with shingles. There is one shingles vaccine available, Shingrix (recombinant zoster vaccine). TheCDCnotes that if you have received Zostavax, a shingles vaccine used in the past, you should still get the Shingrix vaccine. Speak with your doctor to see if you need the shingles vaccine."
1181,Shingles,Shingles complications,"While shingles can be painful and bothersome on its own, it’s important to monitor your symptoms for potential complications: Eye damage can occur if you have a rash or blister too close to your eye. Thecorneais particularly vulnerable. Bacterial skin infections can easily occur from open blisters and can be severe. Pneumoniais possible. Ramsay Hunt syndromecan occur if shingles affects the nerves in your head and can result in partial facial paralysis or hearing loss if untreated. If treated within 72 hours, most people make a full recovery. Brain or spinal cord inflammation, such asencephalitisormeningitis, is possible. These complications are serious and life threatening."
1182,Shingles,Shingles in older adults,"Shingles is particularly common in older adults. The NIA says that of the 1 in 3 people who get shingles in their lifetime,about halfare over 60 years old. This is because the immune systems of older people are more likely to be compromised or weakened. Older adults with shingles are more likely to experience complications than the general population, including more extensive rashes and bacterial infections from open blisters. They’re also more vulnerable to bothpneumoniaand brain inflammation, so it’s important to visit a doctor early on for antiviral treatment. To prevent shingles, theCDCrecommends that adults over 50 years old receive the shingles vaccine."
1183,Shingles,Shingles and pregnancy,"While getting shingles during pregnancy is unusual, theNHSsays it is possible. If you come into contact with someone who has chickenpox or an active shingles infection, you can develop chickenpox if you have not been vaccinated or if you have never had it before. Depending on what trimester you’re in, having chickenpox during pregnancy can result in congenital anomalies. Getting a chickenpox vaccine before pregnancy can be an important step in protecting your child. Shingles is unlikely to cause complications during pregnancy, but it can still be unpleasant. Contact your doctor right away if you develop a rash during pregnancy. Find out more about shingles and pregnancy. Antiviral medications that treat shingles can be used safely during your pregnancy.Antihistaminescan also help reduce itching, and acetaminophen (Tylenol) can reduce pain. Speak with your doctor before taking any medication to treat shingles during pregnancy."
1184,Shingles,Frequently asked questions about shingles,"Here’s a look at some of the common questions people have about shingles. Shingles develop when something triggers the dormant varicella zoster. This is usually because something compromises your immune system. The trigger isn’t always known, but the virus is more common among elderly adults due to their decreased immunity. Otherpossible causesinclude stress, cancer treatment, viruses like HIV, organ transplants, taking immunosuppressive medications, or other medical reasons that reduce your immunity. The first signs of shingles are usually pain and burning on one half of your body in the affected skin area. The varicella-zoster virus that causes both chickenpox and shingles is airborne. It can spread if someone with shingles or chickenpox coughs or sneezes near you or shares your drinking glass or eating utensils. You can also get it if you come in contact with a chickenpox or shingles rash, by touching something in contact with contaminated hands, or by inhaling particles from the blisters. If you contract the virus and you haven’t had chickenpox, you will develop chickenpox. You can only get shingles if you’ve already had chickenpox and the virus is already inside your body. Some people with shingles only experience mild symptoms, such as tingling or itchy skin. For others, it can be very painful. Even a gentle breeze can cause pain. Some people experience intense pain without developing a rash. The pain from shingles usually occurs in the nerves of the: chest neck face lower back abdomen To help relieve the pain, a doctor may prescribe medications such as antivirals or anti-inflammatory medications. A2017 animal studyfound that shingles pain may be due to our immune mechanisms changing how our sensory neurons work after being triggered by the reactivation of the varicella-zoster virus. Although possible, it’s rare to experience shingles more than once. In a2019 study, researchers found the reoccurrence rate of shingles was 5.3 percent over an average of a 4.4-year follow-up period. The researchers found that experiencing shingles that lasted more than 30 days significantly increased the risk of reoccurrence. Other risk factors were: being 51 to 70 years old having shingles lasting longer than 90 days being female having a blood cancer, anautoimmune disease,high blood pressure, ordyslipidemia(high “bad” cholesterol or low “good” cholesterol) No, the Shingrix vaccine can’t cause shingles. According to theImmunization Action Coalition, the Shingrix vaccine only contains a small amount of the herpes zoster virus and doesn’t contain a live virus. The CDC says that about10 percentof people who receive the vaccine experience some redness, swelling, or pain around the injection site. If you have shingles, a condition that’s caused by the varicella-zoster virus, you will usually have an itchy or painful red rash with liquid-filled blisters on one side of your body. You can only develop shingles if you’ve previously had chickenpox. Shingles is not the same ashives, which are itchy, raised welts on your skin. Hives are usually caused by an allergic reaction to a medication, food, or something in your environment."
1185,Shingles,Takeaway,"Shingles is an infection caused by the same virus that causes chickenpox: the varicella-zoster virus. Once this virus infects someone, it remains dormant in their nervous system for a long period of time before reactivating as shingles. This type of viral infection is referred to as herpes zoster or shingles. It is marked by a red, painful rash with burning sensations. The rash can often appear in stripes on either side of the body, usually on the torso, neck, or face."
1186,Shoulder Pain,Overview,"Your shoulder is a ball and socket joint and very mobile. It may hurt for many reasons, from injury and overuse to chronic conditions or diseases. You need to know the cause to get effective treatment. The shoulder has a wide and versatile range of motion. When something goes wrong with your shoulder, it hampers your ability to move freely and can cause a great deal of pain and discomfort. Theshoulderis a ball-and-socket joint that has three main bones: the humerus (long arm bone), the clavicle (collarbone), and the scapula (also known as the shoulder blade). These bones are cushioned by a layer of cartilage. There are two main joints. The acromioclavicular joint is between the highest part of the scapula and the clavicle. The glenohumeral joint is made up of the top, ball-shaped part of the humerus bone and the outer edge of the scapula. This joint is also known as the shoulder joint. The shoulder joint is the most mobile joint in the body. It moves the shoulder forward and backward. It also allows the arm to move in a circular motion and to move up and away from the body. Shoulders get their range of motion from the rotator cuff. The rotator cuff is made up of four tendons. Tendons are the tissues that connect muscles to bone. It may be painful or difficult to lift your arm over your head if the tendons or bones around the rotator cuff are damaged or swollen. You can injure your shoulder by performing manual labor, playing sports, or even by repetitive movement. Certain diseases can bring about pain that travels to the shoulder. These include diseases of the cervical spine (neck), as well as liver,heart, orgallbladder disease. You’re more likely to have problems with your shoulder as you grow older, especially after age 60. This is because the soft tissues surrounding the shoulder tend to degenerate with age. In many cases, you can treat shoulder pain at home. However, physical therapy, medications, or surgery may also be necessary. Here’s what you need know about shoulder pain, including causes, diagnosis, treatment, and prevention."
1187,Shoulder Pain,What causes shoulder pain?,"Several factors and conditions can contribute to shoulder pain. The most prevalent cause isrotator cuff tendinitis. This is a condition characterized by swollen tendons. Another common cause of shoulder pain isimpingement syndromewhere the rotator cuff gets caught between the acromium (part of the scapula that covers the ball) and humeral head (the ball portion of the humerus). Sometimes shoulder pain is the result of injury to another location in your body, usually the neck or biceps. This is known as referred pain. Referred pain generally doesn’t get worse when you move your shoulder. Other causes of shoulder pain include: arthritis torn cartilage torn rotator cuff swollenbursa sacsor tendons bone spurs (bony projections that develop along the edges of bones) pinched nervein the neck or shoulder broken shoulder or arm bone frozen shoulder dislocated shoulder injury due to overuse or repetitive use spinal cord injury heart attack"
1188,Shoulder Pain,How is the cause of shoulder pain diagnosed?,"Your doctor will want to find out the cause of your shoulder pain. They’ll request your medical history and do a physical examination. They’ll feel for tenderness and swelling and will also assess your range of motion and joint stability. Imaging tests, such as anX-rayorMRI, can produce detailed pictures of your shoulder to help with the diagnosis. Your doctor may also ask questions to determine the cause. Questions may include: Is the pain in one shoulder or both? Did this pain begin suddenly? If so, what were you doing? Does the pain move to other areas of your body? Can you pinpoint the area of pain? Does it hurt when you’re not moving? Does it hurt more when you move in certain ways? Is it a sharp pain or a dull ache? Has the area of pain been red, hot, or swollen? Does the pain keep you awake at night? What makes it worse and what makes it better? Have you had to limit your activities because of your shoulder pain? You can book an appointment with a primary care doctor in your area using ourHealthline FindCare tool."
1189,Shoulder Pain,When should I seek medical help?,"You should contact your doctor if you experience fever, inability to move your shoulder, lasting bruising, heat and tenderness around the joint, or pain that persists beyond a few weeks of home treatment. If your shoulder pain is sudden and not related to an injury, call 911 immediately. It may be a sign of aheart attack. Other signs of a heart attack include: trouble breathing chest tightness dizziness excessive sweating pain in the neckor jaw Also, call 911 or go to an emergency room immediately if you injured your shoulder and are bleeding, swollen, or you can see exposed tissue."
1190,Shoulder Pain,What are the treatment options for shoulder pain?,"Treatment will depend on the cause and severity of the shoulder pain. Some treatment options include physical or occupational therapy, asling or shoulder immobilizer, or surgery. Your doctor may also prescribe medication such asnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs)orcorticosteroids. Corticosteroids are powerful anti-inflammatory drugs that can be taken by mouth or your doctor can inject into your shoulder. If you’ve had shoulder surgery, follow after-care instructions carefully. Some minor shoulder pain can be treated at home. Icing the shoulder for 15 to 20 minutes three or four times a day for several days can help reduce pain. Use an ice bag or wrap ice in a towel because putting ice directly on your skin can causefrostbiteand burn the skin. Resting the shoulder for several days before returning to normal activity and avoiding any movements that might cause pain can be helpful. Limit overhead work or activities. Other home treatments include usingover-the-counter nonsteroidal anti-inflammatorymedications to help reduce pain and inflammation and compressing the area with anelastic bandageto reduce swelling."
1191,Shoulder Pain,How can I prevent shoulder pain?,"Simple shoulder exercises can help stretch and strengthen muscles androtator cuff tendons. A physical therapist or occupational therapist can show you how to do them properly. If you’ve had previous shoulder issues, use ice for 15 minutes after exercising to prevent future injuries.

1192,Sinusitis,Overview,"Sinusitis, or a sinus infection, can cause a stuffy or runny nose, a decreased sense of smell, and other symptoms. You can usually manage the symptoms at home with a decongestant. The sinuses are small air pockets located between the eyes and behind the forehead, nose, and cheekbones. When the sinuses and nasal passages become inflamed, it’s known as sinusitis. Inflammation can occur because of conditions such as structural issues in the nose or a sinus infection. The terms “sinusitis” and “sinus infection” are sometimes used interchangeably. Keep reading to learn about the symptoms and causes of sinusitis, how to treat it, and when you may need medical attention."
1193,Sinusitis,What symptoms does sinusitis cause?,"Sinusitis causes fluid buildup in the sinuses. This causes the symptoms of sinusitis, which can be similar to the common cold. Symptoms may include: stuffyorrunnynose postnasal drip(mucus dripping down the back of the throat) and a resulting sore throat headache from sinus pressure facial pressure fatigue cough bad breath or a bad taste in the mouth fever If you experience severe or concerning symptoms, it’s best to talk with a doctor rather than try to manage them at home. Some serious health conditions can also have symptoms that may resemble sinusitis. Sinusitis in a child may cause similar symptoms, such as: cold symptoms that do not improvewithin 10 to 14 days allergy symptoms that do not respond to medication a lingering cough a feverabove 102.2°F (39°C), which is considered ahigh fever thick green or yellow mucus coming from the nose Read aboutmucus and what mucus color changes mean."
1194,Sinusitis,What are the types of sinusitis?,"Doctors classify sinusitis in four main ways, and they all have similar symptoms, though the severity and duration can vary. Acute sinusitishas the shortest duration and resolves on its own. It can last up to4 weeks. A viral infection brought on by the common cold may cause symptoms that typically lastup to 10 daysbefore starting to improve. Viral infections eventually lead to most cases of acute sinusitis, butseasonal allergiescan also cause it. Subacute sinusitis symptoms can lastup to 12 weeks. They typically result from seasonal allergies or a bacterial infection requiring medical treatment. In recurrent acute sinusitis, you have at least four episodes of acute sinusitis over 1 year. Each episode of acute sinusitis lasts at least7 days. Chronic sinusitis lasts formore than 12 weeks. Chronic sinusitis symptoms are often less severe than acute sinusitis symptoms, and fever is rare. Bacterial infection may be to blame in these cases. Additionally, chronic sinusitis commonly occurs alongside persistent allergies or structural nasal issues."
1195,Sinusitis,What causes sinusitis?,"Different causes can lead to the fluid buildup in the sinuses that occurs with sinusitis. Possible causes can include: viral infections like the common cold seasonal allergies bacterial infections that may require antibiotics to clear Sometimes, a cold, allergens, or bacteria can cause too much mucus to form. This mucus buildup can become thick and encourage bacteria and other germs to build up in your sinus cavity, eventually leading to a sinus infection. Anyone can develop sinusitis or a sinus infection, but some people are more prone to it than others. People who may be more likely to get sinusitis include those with: structural issues affecting the nose, such as:adeviated septum, which occurs when the wall of tissue that runs between the left and right nostrils is unevena nasalbone spur, or growthnasal polyps, which are usually noncancerous adeviated septum, which occurs when the wall of tissue that runs between the left and right nostrils is uneven a nasalbone spur, or growth nasal polyps, which are usually noncancerous aweakened immune system a history ofallergies coldsand otherupper respiratory tract infections, which can be caused byviruses, bacteria, or fungi cystic fibrosis, which causes thick mucus to build up in your lungs and other mucous membrane linings mold exposure tobacco smoking dental infection airplane travel, which can expose you to a high concentration of germs"
1196,Sinusitis,How do doctors diagnose sinusitis?,"A doctor typically asks about your symptoms and performs a physical exam before they make a diagnosis. They may check for pressure and tenderness by pressing a finger against your head and cheeks. They may also examine the inside of your nose to look for signs of inflammation. In most cases, the doctor can diagnose sinusitis based on your symptoms and the physical exam results. If a doctor thinks you may have chronic sinusitis, they may recommend imaging tests to examine your sinuses and nasal passages. These tests can reveal mucus blockages and any abnormal structures, such as polyps. Imaging tests:Various imaging tests can be used to make a diagnosis.AnX-rayprovides an image of your sinuses.ACT scanprovides a 3-D picture of your sinuses.AnMRIuses powerful magnets to create images of internal structures. AnX-rayprovides an image of your sinuses. ACT scanprovides a 3-D picture of your sinuses. AnMRIuses powerful magnets to create images of internal structures. Nasal endoscopy:The doctor may alsouse a fiberscope, a lighted tube that passes through your nose, to visualize the inside of your nasal passageways and sinuses directly. During this procedure, the doctor may obtain a sample for culture testing, which can detect the presence of viruses, bacteria, or fungi. Allergy tests:Anallergy testidentifies environmental factors that may cause an allergic reaction. Blood tests:Blood testscan check for conditions that weaken the immune system, such as HIV.

1197,Sinusitis,How do you treat sinusitis?,"Most sinusitis cases are caused by viral infections and may not require treatment. However, over-the-counter (OTC) medications and home remedies may help ease symptoms. Sinusitis commonly occurs with nasal congestion. These tips may help reduce nasal congestion: To help relieve sinus pressure pain, apply awarm, damp clothto your face and forehead several times daily. Anasal saline rinsewith sterile water may help clear the thick and sticky mucus from your nose. Never use tap water for a saline nasal rinse, as some organisms in water can potentially cause a life threatening infection. Stay hydrated with drinks like water and tea to help thin the mucus. You can also use an OTC medication, such as guaifenesin (Mucinex), to thin the mucus. Using ahumidifierin your bedroom can add moisture to the air. You can also turn on the shower and sit in the bathroom with the door closed to surround yourself with steam. Consider using anOTC nasal corticosteroid spray. Decongestants are available over the counter, but you may want to ask a doctor before trying one. For some people, sinusitis can trigger a sinus headache or pressure intheir foreheads and cheeks.OTC medicationssuch as acetaminophen (Tylenol) and ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin) can helprelieve pain. If your symptoms do not improve within a few weeks, you may have a bacterial infection that needs treatment by a doctor.If your symptoms do not improve or worsen again after improving, you may need antibiotics. If you begin taking an antibiotic, it’s important to complete the full course of treatment. Do not stop taking your medication earlier than directed, even if you feel better, as this can lead to bacteria developingresistance to the antibioticand your infection becoming harder to treat. The doctor may have you schedule another visit so they can monitor your condition. If your sinusitis does not improve or worsens by your next visit, the doctor may refer you toan ear, nose, and throat specialist. They may also order additional tests to determine whether allergies are triggering your sinusitis. If your chronic sinusitis does not improve with time and medication, you may undergo surgery to: clear obstructed sinuses repair a deviated septum remove polyps"
1198,Sinusitis,Can you prevent sinusitis?,"Because sinusitis can develop after a cold, the flu, or an allergic reaction, following a lifestyle that supports your immune function and reducing your exposure to germs and allergens may help prevent it. To reduce your risk, you can: Getenough sleepregularly. Get regularphysical activity. Eatnutritious foods, such as fruits and vegetables. Get aflu shotevery year. Wash your handsregularly. Limit exposure tosmoke, chemicals,pollen, and other allergens or irritants. Takeantihistamine medicationto treat allergies and colds. Avoid exposure to people with active respiratory infections, such as a cold or the flu."
1199,Sinusitis,Can sinusitis cause complications?,"Acute sinusitis usually doesn’t cause complications. However, if you have severe sinusitis or a weakened immune system, sinusitis may require hospitalization. Sinusitis caused by a fungal infection can also be serious and life threatening. Some serious health conditions can have symptoms that may initially appear similar to sinusitis. If you have concerning symptoms, it’s best to seek medication attention to rule out more serious conditions, such as: an abscess, which is a walled-off collection ofpusin the sinus cavity meningitis, a life threatening infection that can cause brain and spinal cord damage orbital cellulitis, an infection of the tissue surrounding the eyes"
1200,Sinusitis,The bottom line,"Sinusitis is usually treatable, and most people recover without seeing a doctor or taking antibiotics. However, tell a doctor if you have repeat or chronic sinus issues. You could have an underlying medical condition, such asnasal polyps. Also, it’s best to talk with a doctor if you have severe or concerning symptoms. They may want to perform tests to rule out other health conditions. Read this article in Spanish."

1205,Skin Disorders,Skin disorders in children,"Skin disorders are common in children. Children can experience many of the same skin conditions as adults. Infants and toddlers are also at risk of diaper-related skin problems. Since children have more frequent exposure to other children and germs, they may also develop skin disorders that rarely occur in adults. Many childhood skin problems disappear with age, but children can also inherit permanent skin disorders. In most cases, doctors can treat childhood skin disorders with topical creams, medicated lotions, or condition-specific drugs. Common childhood skin disordersinclude: eczema diaper rash seborrheic dermatitis chickenpox measles warts acne fifth disease hives ringworm rashes from bacterial or fungal infections rashes from allergic reactions"

Some skin conditions have no known cause. Inflammatory bowel diseaseis a term for a group of intestinal disorders that cause prolonged inflammation of the digestive tract. These bowel-related disorders often cause skin problems. Some rugs used to treat these diseasesmay increasethe chance of developing psoriasis. Many people with diabetesexperiencea skin problem due to their condition at some point. Some of these skin disorders only affect people withdiabetes. Others occur more frequently in people with diabetes because the disease increases the risk of infection and blood circulation problems.

1210,Skin Disorders,Frequently asked questions,"Having a skin condition can be distressing. You may experience itching or pain, and if the rash is visible, it can be distressing. All this can have a negative impact on mental health. That said, researchers alsobelievethere may be a biological link between stress and other psychological problems and skin symptoms such as acne, psoriasis, eczema, itching, hives, and more. In addition, there are diseases, such as Lupus, that affect both the brain and the skin, causing both mood and skin-related symptoms. According to a2017 study, the most common skin conditions in the United States are: Other skin conditions dermatitis acne viral skin diseases psoriasis fungal skin diseases hives (urticaria) nonspecific itchy skin (pruritus) scabies alopecia areata The research article specifies that “other skin conditions” include: sunburn lice fly and other infestations pilonidal cyst pemphigus pemphigoid lichen simplex chronicus pityriasis rosea lichen planus erythema multiforme erythema nodosum A few examples of chronic skin conditions include rosacea, psoriasis, and vitiligo. While these conditions can’t be cured, there are treatments that can help manage symptoms."
1211,Skin Disorders,Takeaway,"Different types of conditions affect the skin. Some are chronic, while others are temporary. Some conditions may be painful or uncomfortable, but they’re not dangerous. Other conditions, such as skin cancer, can be life threatening. The treatment for each depends on the specific cause. If you experience any new or unusual skin symptoms, it’s a good idea to have them evaluated by a doctor. Read this article in Spanish. If you need help finding a dermatologist, then check out our FindCare tool here."
1212,Stress,Overview,"Stress is a biological response to a perceived threat. It’s caused by chemicals and hormones surging throughout your body. It can help you respond to a particular problem, but too much can harm your health. Stresstriggers your fight-or-flight response in order to fight the stressor or run away from it. Typically, after the response occurs, your body should relax. Too much constant stress can have negative effects. Stress isn’t necessarily a bad thing. It’s what helped our hunter-gatherer ancestors survive, and it’s just as important in today’s world. It can be healthy when it helps you avoid an accident, meet a tight deadline, or keep your wits about you amid chaos. We all feel stressed at times, but what one person finds stressful may be very different from what another finds stressful. An example of this would be public speaking. Some love the thrill of it and others become paralyzed at the very thought. Stress isn’t always a bad thing, either. Your wedding day, for example, may be considered a good form of stress. But stress should be temporary. Once you’ve passed the fight-or-flight moment, your heart rate and breathing should slow down and your muscles should relax. In a short time, your body should return to its natural state without any lasting negative effects. On the other hand, severe, frequent, or prolonged stress can bementally and physically harmful. And it’s fairly common. When asked,80 percentof Americans reported they’d had at least onesymptom of stressin the past month.Twenty percentreported being under extreme stress. Life being what it is, it’s not possible to eliminate stress completely. But we can learn to avoid it when possible and manage it when it’s unavoidable."
1213,Stress,Defining stress,"Stress is a normal biological reaction to a potentially dangerous situation. When you encounter sudden stress, your brain floods your body with chemicals and hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol. That gets your heart beating faster and sends blood to muscles and important organs. You feel energized and have heightened awareness so you can focus on your immediate needs.These are the different stages of stress and how people adapt."
1214,Stress,Stress hormones,"When you sense danger, thehypothalamusat the base of your brain reacts. It sends nerve and hormone signals to youradrenal glands, which release an abundance of hormones. These hormones are nature’s way of preparing you to face danger and increase your chances of survival. One of these hormones is adrenaline. You might also know it as epinephrine, or the fight-or-flight hormone. In rapid fashion, adrenaline works to: increase your heartbeat increase your breathing rate make it easier for your muscles to useglucose contract blood vessels so blood is directed to the muscles stimulate perspiration inhibitinsulinproduction While this is helpful in the moment, frequent adrenaline surges can lead to: damaged blood vessels high blood pressure, or hypertension higher risk ofheart attackandstroke headaches anxiety insomnia weight gain Here’s what else you should know about an adrenaline rush. Although adrenaline is important, it isn’t the primary stress hormone. That’s cortisol."
1215,Stress,Stress and cortisol,"As the main stress hormone, cortisol plays an essential role in stressful situations. Among its functions are: raising the amount of glucose in your bloodstream helping the brain use glucose more effectively raising the accessibility of substances that help with tissue repair restraining functions that are nonessential in a life-threatening situation altering immune system response dampening the reproductive system and growth process affecting parts of the brain that control fear, motivation, and mood All this helps you deal more effectively with a high-stress situation. It’s a normal process and crucial to human survival. But if your cortisol levels stay high for too long, it has a negative impact on your health. It can contribute to: weight gain high blood pressure sleep problems lack of energy type 2 diabetes osteoporosis mental cloudiness (brain fog) and memory problems a weakened immune system, leaving you more vulnerable to infections It can also have a negative impact on your mood.You can lower your cortisol levels naturally: Here’s how."
1216,Stress,Types of stress,"There are severaltypes of stress, including: acute stress episodic acute stress chronic stress Acute stress happens to everyone. It’s the body’s immediate reaction to a new and challenging situation. It’s the kind of stress you might feel when you narrowly escape a car accident. Acute stress can also come out of something that you actually enjoy. It’s the somewhat-frightening, yet thrilling feeling you get on a roller coaster or when skiing down a steep mountain slope. These incidents of acute stress don’t normally do you any harm. They might even be good for you. Stressful situations give your body and brain practice in developing the best response to future stressful situations. Once the danger passes, your body systems should return to normal. Severe acute stressis a different story. This kind of stress, such as when you’ve faced a life-threatening situation, can lead topost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)or other mental health problems. Episodic acute stress is when you have frequent episodes of acute stress. This might happen if you’re often anxious and worried about things you suspect may happen. You might feel that your life is chaotic and you seemingly go from one crisis to the next. Certain professions, such as law enforcement or firefighters, might also lead to frequent high-stress situations. As with severe acute stress, episodic acute stress can affect your physical health and mental well-being. When you have high-stress levels for an extended period of time, you have chronic stress. Long-term stress like this can have a negative impact on your health. It may contribute to: anxiety cardiovascular disease depression high blood pressure a weakened immune system Chronic stress can also lead to frequent ailments such as headaches, an upset stomach, and sleep difficulties.Gaining insights into the different types of stress and how to recognize them may help."

1226,Stroke,Overview,"A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds or when there’s a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. The rupture or blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain’s tissues. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Every year, more than 795,000 U.S. people have a stroke. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) estimates that between 82% and 90% of strokes are preventable through lifestyle measures, including quitting smoking, limiting alcohol use, maintaining a moderate weight, and getting regular medical checkups. A stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain ruptures and bleeds or when there’s a blockage in the blood supply to the brain. The rupture or blockage prevents blood and oxygen from reaching the brain’s tissues. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), stroke is a leading cause of death in the United States. Every year, more than 795,000 U.S. people have a stroke. Without oxygen, brain cells and tissue become damaged and begin to die within minutes. It’s important to be able to recognize the symptoms of a stroke and to seek a speedy diagnosis and treatment."
1227,Stroke,What are the symptoms of a stroke?,"The loss of blood flow to the brain damages tissues within the brain.Symptoms of a strokeshow up in the body parts controlled by the damaged areas of the brain. The sooner a person having a stroke gets care, the better their outcome is likely to be. For this reason, it’s helpful to know the signs of a stroke so you can act quickly. Stroke symptoms caninclude: paralysis numbness or weakness in the arm, face, and leg, especially on one side of the body (hemiparesis) trouble speaking or understanding others slurred speech confusion, disorientation, or lack of responsiveness sudden behavioral changes, especially increased agitation vision problems, such as trouble seeing in one or both eyes with vision blackened or blurred, or double vision trouble walking loss of balance or coordination dizziness severe, sudden headachewith an unknown cause seizures nausea or vomiting Recognizing the symptoms of a stroke in someone can play an important role in improving their outcome. Experts recommend youBE-FAST: Balance:Are they having trouble with balance or coordination? Eyes:Are they experiencing visual symptoms, like double vision or blurry vision? Face:Does one side of their face droop if they try to smile? Arms:Can they lift both arms or is one arm weak or numb? Speech:Is their speech slurred or difficult to understand? Time:If any of the above symptoms are present, time to call 911 or your local emergency services. Prompt treatment is key to preventing brain damage, long-term disability, or death. It’s better to be overly cautious when dealing with a stroke, so don’t be afraid to get emergency medical help if you think yourecognize the signs of a stroke."
1228,Stroke,What causes a stroke?,"Thecause of a strokedepends on the type of stroke. Strokes fall intothree main categories: ischemic stroke hemorrhagic stroke transient ischemic attack (TIA) The type of stroke you have affects your treatment and recovery process. During anischemic stroke, the arteries supplying blood to the brain narrow or become blocked. Blood clots or severely reduced blood flow to the brain cause these blockages. Pieces of plaque breaking off and blocking a blood vessel can also cause them. Two types of blockagescan lead to ischemic stroke: A cerebral embolism (embolic stroke) occurs when a blood clot forms in another part of the body — often the heart or arteries in the upper chest and neck — and moves through the bloodstream until it hits an artery too narrow to let it pass. The clot gets stuck, stops the flow of blood, and causes a stroke. Cerebral thrombosis (thrombotic stroke) occurs when a blood clot develops at the fatty plaque within the blood vessel. According to the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI),87%of strokes are ischemic. Ahemorrhagic strokehappens when an artery in the brain breaks open or leaks blood. The blood from that artery creates excess pressure in the skull and swells the brain, damaging brain cells and tissues. Doctors categorize hemorrhagic strokes into two primary types: Anintracerebral hemorrhagic (ICH) strokeis the most common type of hemorrhagic stroke. It happens when the tissues surrounding the brain fill with blood after an artery bursts. Asubarachnoid hemorrhagic (SAH) strokeis less common. It causes bleeding in the area between the brain and the tissues that cover it. TheNHLBIstates that 10% of strokes are ICH, while 3% are SAH. ATIA, or ministroke, occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked temporarily. Symptoms are similar to those of a full stroke. However, they typically disappear after a few minutes or hours when the blockage moves and blood flow is restored. A blood clot usually causes a TIA. While it’s not technically a full stroke, a TIA serves as a warning that an actual stroke may happen. Because of this, it’s best not to ignore it. Seek the same treatment you would for amajor strokeand get emergency medical help. According to the American Stroke Association, close to1 in 5people with a TIA will have a full stroke within 3 months. Read more: “What Are the Different Types of Strokes?”"

1231,Stroke,How to prevent a stroke,"The NHLBI estimates that82% to 90%of strokes are preventable. While lifestyle changes can’t prevent all strokes, many of these changes can make a significant difference in lowering your risk. Experts recommend you consider the following: Quit smoking:If you smoke,quittingnow will lower your risk of stroke. You can reach out to a doctor to create a quit plan. Limit alcohol use:Heavy alcohol consumption canraise your blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of stroke. If reducing your intake is difficult, contact a doctor for help. Keep a moderate weight:Overweight and obesity increase the risk of stroke. To help manage your weight, eat abalanced dietand stay physically active. Both steps can also reduce blood pressure and cholesterol levels. Get regular checkups:Talk with a doctor about how often to get a checkup for blood pressure, cholesterol, and any conditions you may have. They can also support you in making these lifestyle changes and offer guidance. Read more: “10 Ways to Lower Your Risk of and Prevent Stroke”"
1232,Stroke,How do doctors diagnose stroke?,"Todiagnose stroke, a doctor will first ask you or a family member about your symptoms and what you were doing when they arose. They’ll take your medical history to find out your stroke risk factors. They’ll also: ask what medications you take check your blood pressure listen to your heart You’ll also have a physical exam, during which your doctor will evaluate you for: balance coordination weakness numbness in your arms, face, or legs signs of confusion vision issues Your doctor will then do certain imaging and blood tests to help confirm a stroke diagnosis. These tests can help them determine whether you had a stroke and, if so: what may have caused it what part of the brain is affected whether you have bleeding in the brain Read more: “What Tests Can Diagnose a Stroke?”"
1233,Stroke,What is the treatment for stroke?,"Proper medical evaluation and prompt treatment are vital to recovering from a stroke. Treatment will depend on the type of stroke. Since a blood clot or blockage in the brain causes these stroke types, doctors essentially treat them with similar techniques. They caninclude: thrombolytic drugs, namely tissue plasminogen activator (tPA or Atlepase), to break up blood clots in your brain’s arteries within 4.5 hours of the onset of symptoms mechanical thrombectomyto remove the blood clot within 24 hours of symptom onset stentsto support weakened artery walls surgery to remove plaquefrom your arteries aspirin or other blood thinners to prevent further blood clots Strokes caused by bleeds or leaks in the brain require different treatment strategies. Treatments for hemorrhagic strokeinclude: medications to reduce blood pressure, prevent seizures, and prevent blood vessel constriction surgery to repair the brain aneurysm, usually by processes called coiling orclipping craniotomyto relieve pressure on the brain In addition to emergency treatment, your healthcare team will advise you on ways to prevent future strokes. Read more: “A Complete Guide to Stroke Treatments”"
1234,Stroke,Stroke medications,"Doctors use various medications both to treat stroke and prevent future strokes. The type of medication your doctor prescribes depends largely on the type of stroke you had. Common stroke medicationsinclude: tPA, injected into a blood vessel to break up blood clots during a stroke anticoagulantslike warfarin (Coumadin, Jantoven) to prevent blood clots or stop existing clots from getting larger direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs), a newer drug class of anticoagulants that work faster and require less monitoring antiplateletslike aspirin andclopidogrel(Plavix) to make it more difficult for your blood to clot statinsto lower high blood cholesterol levels and reduce plaque buildup on artery walls that could lead to a clot blood pressure medications, as high blood pressure is the leading risk factor for stroke Read more: “Stroke Drugs”"
1235,Stroke,What can I expect during recovery from a stroke?,"Stroke is aleading cause of disabilityin the United States. While some people will fully recover, many will have long-term disabilities. It’s important that recovery and rehabilitation from a stroke start as soon as possible. In fact, stroke recovery should begin in the hospital. In a hospital, a care team can stabilize your condition and assess the effects of the stroke. They can identify underlying factors and begin therapy to help you regain some of your affected skills. Stroke recovery typically focuses on four main areas: speech therapyto relearn how to speak and help with swallowing difficulties cognitive therapyto regain former patterns of thinking and behavior relearning sensory skills, such as temperature, pressure, and pain, often with the help of anoccupational therapist physical therapyto regain strength and balance and adjust to any limitations Read more: “Stroke Recovery: What to Expect”"
1236,Stroke,Takeaway,"If you suspect you may be experiencing symptoms of a stroke, it’s vital you seek emergency medical treatment as soon as possible. Healthcare professionals can only provide clot-busting medication in the first few hours after the signs of a stroke begin. Early treatment is one of the most effective ways to reduce your risk of long-term complications and disability. While it’s not always possible to completely prevent a stroke, certain lifestyle changes can significantly reduce your risk. Medications can also help reduce the risk of blood clots, which can lead to stroke. If your doctor believes you might be at risk of stroke, they will work with you to find a prevention strategy that works for you, including medical intervention and lifestyle changes."
1237,Teething,Overview,"Teething is a normal part of the development process, but it can be painful and uncomfortable for your baby. Several home remedies can offer relief. Teething syndrome — or simply “teething” — is a normal process that some infants go through as their teeth break, or cut, through their gums. According to the American Dental Association, babies start teething when they are between 6 and 12 months old. By the time a child is 3 years old, they should have a first or primary set of 20 teeth. Having teeth means your child will be able to eat a bigger variety of foods, but getting there can be tough on both baby and parent. There are ways you can make your child more comfortable during the process, and there are signs that signal when it’s time to call the pediatrician."
1238,Teething,Understanding why babies teethe,"Babies are born with a full set of teeth underneath their gums. During the first year of life, these teeth begin to cut through the gums. These teeth break through the gums in stages. Typically, the classic bottom teeth — often referred to as pegs — come in first, followed by the top middle teeth. From this point on, the remaining teeth will cut through the gums over a period of three years, according to theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics. Some children may even get their full sets of teeth after 2 years of age."
1239,Teething,Symptoms associated with teething,Each infant has a unique mix of symptoms during teething. The most common symptoms are mild irritability and a lack of appetite. Many babies have few or no symptoms when their teeth break through the gums. Some babies will show at least one or two of the following symptoms when they begin to teethe: drooling chewing on solid objects mild fussiness and crankiness irritability loss of appetite sore and tender gums red and swollen gums
1240,Teething,Relieving your baby’s teething pain,"While teething is a natural process, there are sometried and true methodsto help relieve your baby’s discomfort. You can try rubbing your child’s gums with a damp washcloth, a clean finger, or a special gum-rubbing finger pad. Teething rings are also popular options. Babies can chew on these to ease the discomfort. If you can, chill a teething ring in the refrigerator beforehand. This provides pressure on the gums along with a soothing coolness. You should never freeze the ring because it can break and possibly choke your infant. With time, you should begin to introduce harder foods, like cold fruit and vegetables, to your baby’s diet. This is an important milestone that can also alleviate teething discomfort. Make sure to stay with the child at all times so you can monitor their chewing and prevent choking. During teething, a baby’s constant drooling can irritate their skin. Use a bib to keep your baby’s chin as dry as possible."
1241,Teething,Relief with medications,"If your infant is really having a tough time, you might want to give them infant acetaminophen to relieve discomfort. You can also apply a teething gel. However, avoid gels that contain choline salicylate and benzocaine. These are not safe for infants, since they can reduce the levels of oxygen in the blood. Teething gels give only brief, if any, relief. There are other supposed remedies out there that should be avoided. In fact, such methods can actually harm your baby. Never: give a baby aspirin or rub it on the gums use alcohol on the baby’s gums put completely frozen objects directly on the gums allow your child to chew on hard plastic toys — this poses both an oral health risk as well as a choking hazard Many parents believe that high fever and diarrhea are also symptoms of teething, but this is usually not the case. Contact your pediatrician if your baby develops a fever or diarrhea, or if they’re having continued discomfort."
1242,Teething,Outlook,"Teething is a natural part of an infant’s growth and development. Due to the pain and discomfort, it’s easy for parents to become anxious about the process. Know that the symptoms of teething will eventually pass, and that your child will one day have a healthy set of teeth thanks to your efforts to keep up with good oral hygiene. Any specific concerns or prolonged discomfort should be addressed with your child’s pediatrician or family doctor."
1243,TMJ Disorders,Overview,"TMJ disorders can often be treated succesfully at home, including changing posture or reducing stress. Most TMJ warrants changes in lifestyle habits, possibly combined with medications to ease pain and discomfort. The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) is the joint that connects your mandible (lower jaw) to your skull. The joint can be found on both sides of your head in front of your ears. It allows your jaw to open and close, letting you to speak and eat. The abbreviation “TMJ” has also been used to refer to a group of health conditions related to your jaw. However, this is becomingmore commonly abbreviatedas “TMD” or “TMJD” to distinguish the temporomandibular joint itself from TMJ disorders. These disorders can cause: tenderness at the joint facial pain difficulty moving the joint According to theNational Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research, as many as 10 million Americans suffer from TMJ disorders. They are more common among women than men. These disorders are treatable, but they have many different possible causes. This can make diagnosis difficult. Keep reading to learn more about TMJ disorders. You should discuss any concerns with your doctor."
1244,TMJ Disorders,What are the symptoms of TMJ disorders?,"The symptoms of TMJ disorders depend on the severity and cause of your condition. The most common symptom of TMJ disorders is pain in the jaw and surrounding muscles. According to2021 research, other symptoms typically associated with these disorders include: pain that can be felt in the face or neck stiffness in the muscles of the jaw limited movement of the jaw locking of the jaw clicking or popping sound from the TMJ site dental issues, such as the wearing down of teeth tinnitus (ringing in the ear) vertigo headaches shift in the jaw, changing the way that the upper and lower teeth align (calledmalocclusion) Symptoms may show up on just one side of the face or both."
1245,TMJ Disorders,How are TMJ disorders treated?,"Because TMJ disorders can have a variety of causes, there are also a variety of ways to treat them. Physicians will typically advise starting with home treatments first. This is because many of the more complicated treatmentsstill need more studiesto prove their efficiency. In a lot of cases, the symptoms of TMJ disorders can be treated with self-care practices at home. To ease the symptoms of TMJ at home, you can: Eat soft foods. Use ice to reduce swelling. Reduce jaw movements. Avoid chewing gum and tough foods (like beef jerky). Take measures to reduce stress. Use jaw-stretching exercises to help improve jaw movement. If you find that your TMJ is not eased by using home treatments, some medications — both over-the-counter and prescribed by a doctor — may provide more relief. Some of these medications include: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) corticosteroids muscle relaxers antidepressants local anesthetics Your doctor will help you decide which medication is best for you, based on your personal condition and health history. Occasionally, your doctor may recommend physical therapy. Depending on the area that needs attention, your therapy could include: heat therapy cooling therapy acupuncture tissue mobilization resistance exercises stretches If you and your doctor believe your TMJ disorder may be caused by stress, talk therapy or stress management exercises are additional options. If your symptoms don’t improve with the methods listed above, your doctor may decide that your condition requires serious treatment. Botox injectionsare one such treatment. Typically, these injections are done for painful trigger points or chronic teeth grinding. The evidence behind this treatment isstill lacking, however. In very rare cases, your doctor may recommend surgery to treat your condition. Procedures can include: corrective dental treatment to improve your bite and align your teeth arthrocentesis, which removes fluid and debris from the joint surgery to replace the joint Procedures used to treat this condition may, in some cases, make your symptoms worse. Talk with your doctor about the potential risks of these procedures."
1246,TMJ Disorders,What causes TMJ disorders?,"In many cases, it’s not known what causes TMJ disorders. Trauma to the jaw or joint may play a role. There are also other health conditions that may contribute to the development of TMJ disorders. These include: arthritis erosion (wearing away) of the joint habitual grinding or clenching of the teeth structural jaw issues present at birth growth disorders While there are some factors that are often associated with the development of TMJ disorders, they haven’t been proven to be a direct cause. Some of these include: female hormones (it’s theorized that estrogen may play a role in the development of TMJ) poor posture that strains the muscles of the neck and face prolonged stress joint hypermobility"
1247,TMJ Disorders,How are TMJ disorders diagnosed?,"TMJ disorders can be difficult to diagnose. There are no standard tests to diagnose most of the disorders that fall under that title. A doctor may refer you to a dentist, or an ear, nose, and throat (ENT) specialist to diagnose your condition. A healthcare professional may examine your to see if there is swelling or tenderness. They may also use several different imaging tests. These can include: X-rays.X-raysof the jaw and teeth usually involve you biting down on a small mouthpiece as your dentist moves an imaging machine around your head. These X-rays will allow your dentist to see the bones in and around your jaw, as well as your teeth placement. CT scan.ACT scanof the jaw allows your doctor to see the bones and joint tissues in a more advanced way than a regular X-ray. MRI.An MRI of the jaw will reveal if there are problems with the structure of the jaw. An MRI, ormagnetic resonance imaging scan, uses a magnetic field to show detailed images of organs and tissues."
1248,TMJ Disorders,How can TMJ be prevented?,"You may not be able to prevent TMJ disorder from developing, but you might be able to reduce symptoms by lowering your stress levels, employing physical therapy and exercises, and working with a dentist or doctor if you often grind your teeth at night. Possible solutions for teeth grinding include wearing a mouth guard at night and occasionally taking muscle relaxants."
1249,TMJ Disorders,Frequently Asked Questions,"TMJ can be caused by a variety of issues, such as trauma to the jaw or persistent stress, so curing the symptoms is directly connected to curing, or easing, the condition that caused them. However, many individuals find that their TMJ symptomsimprove or even go away on their ownwithin weeks or months if home remedies are employed. While many people find their TMJ symptoms go away on their own after addressing the root cause, other individuals may deal with more serious symptoms that can affect their quality of life. Even when someone is dealing with a more serious case of TMJ disorder,it’s recommended to avoidaggressive treatments such as surgery whenever possible, because there is still not enough evidence to show that these irreversible methods work. There are a wide variety of treatments available for TMJ disorders. If one doesn’t work for you right away, work with your doctor to find one that does. TMJ isn’t life threatening, but if it’s not treated, it can cause pretty persistent discomfort and tension in and around your jaw. It’s also possible that the affected joints could become inflamed, and there may even be damage to your teeth. You don’t have to deal with the pain and discomfort of TMJ alone. Talk with your doctor or dentist about your symptoms."
1250,TMJ Disorders,Takeaway,"The outlook for TMJ disorders depends on the cause of the condition. TMJ disorders can be successfully treated in many people with at-home remedies, such as changing posture or reducing stress. If your condition is caused by a chronic (long-term) disease such as arthritis, lifestyle changes may not be enough. Arthritis can wear down the joint over time and increase pain. There are, however, many treatments to help with thesymptoms of arthritisitself. Most cases of TMJ disorder warrant changes in lifestyle habits, possibly combined with medications to ease pain and discomfort. Aggressive treatments are rarely needed. Talk with your doctor about your options to determine what treatment is right for you."
1251,Tongue Problems,Overview,"The tongue is a muscular organ in the mouth. When there are problems, this usually shows in the tongue’s appearance and sensations, and your ability to use it to help chew your food and speak. The tongue is a muscle-based organ that sits against the floor of the mouth and goes back into the pharynx. It’s attached to the jaw, thehyoid bonein the neck, and the skull, extending back further than what’s visible inside the mouth. The tongue is an organ that humans, and many other animals, use to help them chew and swallow food. Moving your tongue against your palate and your teeth is also vital for your ability to speak. The outer covering of the tongue consists of a wet mucosa. The top part contains tiny papillae, the small dots that provide the tongue with its rough texture. These papillae contain taste buds that let you taste food. A human tongue can have2,000-8,000taste buds, which are classified intothree types. These taste buds contain cells that activate in order to detect different flavors. Depending on their function, taste buds areshapeddifferently and located on different areas of the tongue. Many tongue problems often aren’t serious. But sometimes, your symptoms might occur due to an underlying condition that requires medical treatment. You can prevent many tongue problems by practicinggood oral hygiene. If you’re already experiencing tongue problems, some simple home remedies may help relieve your symptoms. In this article, we’ll go over possible problems with the tongue. We’ll also look at causes, diagnosis, and how to care for these problems at home."
1252,Tongue Problems,Symptoms of tongue problems,"Possible symptoms that a person may experience related to the tongue include: apartial or complete loss of tasteor changes in your ability to taste sour, salty, bitter, or sweet flavors difficulty moving your tongue tongue swelling a change from the normal color of your tongue to orpatches of colorthat are white, bright pink, black, or brown pain either all over the tongue or only in certain spots a change in the size of the tongue like with swelling difficulty in moving the tongue a burning sensation either all over the tongue or only in certain spots a furry orhairyappearance of the tongue"
1253,Tongue Problems,Causes of tongue problems,"The specific symptoms you’re experiencing will help your doctor identify the cause of your tongue problem. These causes may be: BMSis also known as glossodynia, glossopyrosis, and stomatopyrosis. It’s a chronic condition thatcan causea burning sensation on the tongue or elsewhere in the mouth. It may also be associated with mouth dryness and a change in your perception of flavor to a bitter or metallic taste. Usually, a doctor would diagnose BMS after excluding other causes. Tongue burning can also occur inpostmenopausal people. It can also occur due to exposure to irritants like cigarette smoke. See a doctor if you experience tongue burning to determine the right cause and treatment. Macroglossiarefers to when your tongue is larger than what it should be. The condition is also called “big tongue” or “enlarged tongue.” You may be born with the condition or acquire it later in life, though inheriting the condition without an underlying causeis rare. Most cases have underlying causes like: Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome Hunter syndrome Down syndrome Pompe disease Maroteux – Lamy syndrome idiopathic muscular hypertrophy adenoid hyperplasia venolymphatic malformations likehemangiomaandlymphatic malformation A swollen tongue may be a symptom of a disease or medical condition, like: acromegaly, which is an excess of growth hormone (GH) in the body amyloidosis, which is an abnormal excess of the protein amyloid myxedema, which is severe hypothyroidism Rhabdomyoma, which is araretumor in the cardia muscle or in the aerodigestive tract When the tongue swells very suddenly, the likely reason is an allergic reaction. This can result inangioedemaon the tongue or difficulty breathing. Difficulty breathing due to tongue swelling is a medical emergency. If this occurs, you should get medical help right away Atrophic glossitis is a condition in which the tongue is missing some or all of its papillae, making its usually rough surface smooth. As a result, if you have this condition, youmay haveproblems tasting food. In addition, you may also experience pain, burning, and numbness in the tongue. Several underlying causes can potentially cause atrophic glossitis. These include: Nutrient deficiency, such a lack of sufficient pyridoxine, folic acid, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B12, zinc, iron, and vitamin E protein deficiency candidiasis Helicobacter pylori infection Insufficientsalivaproduction Herpes stomatitis is also known as oral herpes, cold sores, or fever blisters. The cause is usually type 1 herpes simplex virus or HSV-1. Cold sores can form on the lips, gums, throat, as well as tongue. In some cases, oral herpes soremay occurwith other symptoms like a sore throat, swollen lymph nodes, fever, headache, nausea, and other aches or pains. In this case, it’s known as Herpetic gingivostomatitis, which ismost commonin children under age 6 but may also occur in adults. Tongue herpesprimarily occurs due to HSV-1, but you could getHSV-2from having unprotected sexual intercourse. Symptoms will begin as a painful or itchy area that may be red and may swell. After the sore forms, it’ll look either white or yellow. In addition, pain in the tongue can occur due to: injury infection inflamed papillae, usually due to a bite or irritation from hot foods acanker sore tongue cancer, which may or may not cause pain anemia irritating dentures orbraces neuralgia, which is a severe pain that occurs along a damaged nerve. geographic tongue, which typically causes mild discomfort A bright pink color on the tongue is most often due to a deficiency in iron,folic acid, orvitamin B-12. Anallergic reaction to glutencan also cause this. Awhite tongueis usually a result of smoking, drinking alcohol, poor oral hygiene, or candida infection. White lines or bumps may be an inflammation called oral lichen planus. People think this occurs due to an abnormal immune response that may occur from an underlying condition, likehepatitis Corallergies. Additionally,leukoplakiaanderythroplakiacan cause white or red patches on the tongue that can be precursors to cancer. To rule this out, your doctor will probably want to do a biopsy of the tongue. If you have a black hairy tongue, this can be caused by a course of antibiotics. Radiationto the head or neck can also lead to hairiness on the tongue. This can also develop from too much exposure to an irritating substance, like coffee or mouthwash, or if you smoke. A benign condition called black hairy tongue (BHT) can cause the papillae on the tongue to develop abnormally. Thismay makeyour tongue look black and hairy, though the color can also be brown, yellow, green, blue, or normal color. In addition, the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) can lead to a disease called hairy leukoplakia (HL), which can also cause a hairy tongue. Itoften occursin people living with HIV but may also occur in people who aren’t."
1254,Tongue Problems,How are tongue problems diagnosed?,"You should make an appointment to see your doctor for diagnosis and treatment if your tongue problem is severe, unexplained, or persists for several days with no signs of improvement. You should also see your doctor if you have: larger sores than you’ve previously had recurring or frequent sores recurring or frequent pain a persistent problem lasting longer than 2 weeks tongue pain that doesn’t improve with over-the-counter pain (OTC) medications or self-care measures tongue problems with a highfever extreme difficulty eating or drinking During your appointment, your doctor will thoroughly examine your tongue. They’ll look at the tongue as a whole, see how it functions, and examine the surface of the tongue. Your doctor will also ask you several questions about your tongue and your symptoms. They’ll want to know: how long you’ve had the symptoms whether your ability to taste has changed what kind of pain you have if it’s difficult to move your tongue if you have any other issues in your mouth if you have any history of tobacco or alcohol use"
1255,Tongue Problems,Tongue tests,"If your doctor isn’t able to make a diagnosis based on the exam and the answers to your questions, they may order some tests. Most likely, your doctor will want to check your overall health and rule out various disorders with acomplete blood count (CBC)test. If they think you may have something serious like tongue cancer, they may order a biopsy of the tongue. In some cases, you may need an indirect pharyngoscopy and laryngoscopy, a procedure in which a doctor may use a small mirror set onto long, thin handles to examine the base of your tongue. More commonly, they’ll use a flexible, fiberoptic endoscope for the procedure. If the doctor thinks you have a venolymphatic malformation on your tongue, they may send you for an imaging test. A diagnosis of an underlying syndrome may require genetic testing to confirm. Once you have a diagnosis, your doctor will recommend treatments for your specific problem."
1256,Tongue Problems,Home care for tongue problems,"You can prevent or relieve some tongue problems by practicing good dental hygiene. Brush and floss regularly, and see your dentist for routine checkups and cleanings. Most dentists will examine your oral cavity for any lesions that could be cancerous. In addition, avoiding risky activities like smoking or chewing tobacco, chewingbetel nuts, or drinking alcohol may help reduce your risk of developing tongue cancer and other types of oral cancer. For example, if you have a canker sore or a sore that occurs due to a mouth injury, you should do the following: Avoid hot and spicy foods. Try to drink only cold beverages and eat only bland, soft foods until the sore has healed. You may also try OTC oral pain treatments. Rinse your mouth with warm saltwater or a mixture of warm water and baking soda. Ice the sore. Call your doctor if you don’t see any improvement in the next 2 to 3 weeks."
1257,Tongue Problems,Takeaway,"Many things can cause problems with the tongue. Talk with a doctor for a correct diagnosis and treatment if you have any unusual symptoms, especially if the symptoms last a long time."
1258,Type 1 Diabetes,Overview,"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition where the body cannot produce insulin, requiring individuals to manage blood sugar levels through insulin injections and lifestyle adjustments. Common symptoms of type 1 diabetes include excessive thirst, frequent urination, blurred vision, and fatigue, which can sometimes be mistaken for other conditions or stress. Managing type 1 diabetes involves constant monitoring of blood sugar levels, balanced eating, regular exercise, and awareness of factors like mental health and medications to prevent long-term complications. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition that means people cannot make insulin in their bodies naturally. As a result, they can’t regulate blood sugar levels as well as those without the condition. This means they must inject insulin to keep their blood sugar levels in target range and manage other aspects of life, including diet, exercise, sleep, and mental health. People with T1D may develop complications over time, which can lead to other challenges in managing this condition and life in general."
1259,Type 1 Diabetes,Most common symptoms of type 1 diabetes,"The following arecommon T1D symptoms: excessive hunger excessive thirst blurred vision fatigue frequent urination dramatic weight loss in a short period of time Thesymptoms of type 1 diabetesmay not always be clear, especially for parents who may not immediately recognize these symptoms in their children. T1D can resemble the flu, and they can misunderstand it as a typical effect related to busy school or sports activities. With adults, they can mistake T1D for the same effects from everyday stress, work, and life situations. But T1D can develop suddenly and become life threatening in a short amount of time, becoming a medical emergency that might lead to coma or worse. You can watch for thesecommon symptomsas warning signs for type 1 diabetes. You may need to seek emergency medical care."
1260,Type 1 Diabetes,Why does T1D develop?,"Researchers don’t know the exact cause of type 1 diabetes. What they know is that T1D involves anautoimmune reaction, in which the body attacks and kills the insulin-making cells in the pancreas for some reason. Geneticsplays a rolein that process. T1D may be passed down through generations of a family, though it’s unclear how the pattern works and why some people in a family will develop diabetes while others will not. Researchers have identified certain gene variants that may increase a person’s risk. A parent and child may share these variants between them, generation after generation. However, not everyone who has these genes develops the condition. For example, identical twins with the same genes may or may not develop the condition. If one twin has T1D, the other twin develops the conditionhalf the timeor less. This suggests that genes aren’t the only factor. Researchers also believe there may be environmental causes that play a part in this T1D development. This might include traumatic experiences, including the flu or other viruses and illnesses (including COVID-19), which appear to tip the scales over that line toward T1D development. Whatever the reasons, this leads to the body not being able to make insulin itself. Insulinis a hormone that helps your body’s cells use glucose (sugar) for energy. Your body gets glucose from the food you eat. Insulin allows glucose to pass from your blood into your body’s cells. When the cells have enough, your liver and muscle tissues store the extraglucosein the form of glycogen. It’s broken down into blood sugar and released when you need energy between meals, during exercise, or while you sleep. With T1D, your body is unable to process glucose due to the lack of insulin. Glucose from your food can’t make its way into your cells. This leaves too much glucose circulating in your blood. High blood sugar levels can lead to both short- and long-term complications."
1261,Type 1 Diabetes,Diagnosis of type 1 diabetes,"Healthcare professionals usually diagnose through a series of tests. Some may be quick in a doctor’s office, while others may require bloodwork at a separate lab or even hours of preparation or monitoring in a hospital. A healthcare professional candiagnose T1Dif: fasting blood sugar is greater than 126 mg/dL on two separate tests random blood sugar is greater than 200 mg/dL, along with symptoms of diabetes hemoglobin A1Cis greater than 6.5% on two separate tests When blood sugar gets so high thatdiabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)occurs, a person can become very ill. This is often the reason people end up in the hospital or their doctor’s office and they receive a diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. If you have any of the symptoms of diabetes, your doctor will likely order tests. Doctors also use the same criteria to diagnose type 2 diabetes. People with type 1 diabetes sometimes receive amisdiagnosisas having type 2 diabetes. This may be more common in adults, who could have T1D that sometimes develops more gradually. A doctor may not realize that you’ve received a misdiagnosis until you begin developing complications or worsening symptoms despite treatment."
1262,Type 1 Diabetes,How is T1D different from other diabetes types?,"Type 1 diabetes is not the same as type 2 diabetes or other types, though they can mirror each other in many ways — from the symptoms to insulin treatment and daily blood sugar checks to certain diabetes complications that may develop over time. There are a handful of diabetes types, but the main types are type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Here are some of the key differences between T1D and T2D, in particular: Experts historically viewed T1D as “juvenile diabetes” because it most often affected children. It is an outdated term and doesn’t reflect the reality that T1D can occur at any age. Just because someone is an adult displaying diabetes symptoms does not mean they have T2D. For people withtype 2 diabetes, their body stops responding and using insulin as well as it should to move glucose from the blood into the cells despite having adequate levels of the hormone. Eventually, their bodies may stop making adequate insulin entirely. Type 1 diabetes develops very quickly, and symptoms are obvious. For people with type 2 diabetes, the condition can develop over many years. A person with type 2 diabetes may not know they have it until they have a complication. Another type of diabetes calledLatent Autoimmune Diabetes in Adults (LADA)is sometimes referred to as type 1.5 diabetes. People may receive a misdiagnosis of type 1 diabetes instead of LADA, which may develop more gradually. A qualified medical professional can help correctly diagnose the type of diabetes, along with your input if you feel that you may be experiencing T1D or LADA."
1263,Type 1 Diabetes,How do you treat type 1 diabetes?,"If you receive a T1D diagnosis, your body can’t make its own insulin. You’ll need to take insulin to help your body use the sugar in your blood. This may mean taking insulin through injections with a syringe and glass vial, a prefilled plasticinsulin pen, or using a fast-actinginhaled insulin called Afrezza. Some people may also choose to use a device known as an insulin pump, which attaches to your body and delivers insulin more constantly throughout the day and night through a small cannula inserted through the top layer of skin. Some people find using aninsulin pumpmore convenient than sticking themselves with a needle, and this device may also provide more flexibility and the ability to adjust insulin doses at different times to balance out blood sugar levels. Insulin itselfcan be expensive, no matter how you choose to administer it. The same applies to insulin pens, pumps, and other diabetes supplies needed to take insulin and manage your condition. People with insurance may check their healthcare coverage and plans, including Medicare and Medicaid, to determine what types of insulin are best covered and how much they may cost. The amount of insulin someone with T1D needs varies throughout the day and night. Managing blood sugars and tracking how much different foods and drinks affect your blood sugar levels, along with exercise and other factors, can help you and your diabetes care team determine how much insulin you may need. Several types ofinsulinexist. Your doctor may have you try more than one to find what works best for you. Diabetes managementhas many parts, beyond just taking insulin. This condition means constant management of blood sugar levels, which can rise or fall as a result of many factors. Just some of those reasons can include: eating patterns and carbohydrate amounts exercise habits sleep schedules mental health and stress levels other non-diabetes conditions (comorbidities) different medications for diabetes and other health reasons"
1264,Type 1 Diabetes,Low blood sugars,"Type 1 diabetes can lead to low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) and high blood sugar levels (hyperglycemia). People can manage both, but these can also become more severe and require immediate treatment. Hypoglycemia occurs when blood sugar is too low, usually when the body has too much insulin. It can happen if you wait too long to eat or have a snack, or if you exercise too much. Some of the most common low blood sugarsymptomsmay include: shakiness blurry vision inability to focus or think clearly sweating shivers no matter the temperature unexplained and sudden mood changes loss of consciousness"
1265,Type 1 Diabetes,High blood sugar levels,"Conversely,hyperglycemiais high blood sugar. Depending on the level of hyperglycemia, it can cause you to feel sluggish, unfocused, or even sick. If blood sugars get too high and you don’t have enough insulin in the system, this can lead to potentially dangerous DKA.Symptomsmay include: rapid breathing dry skinand mouth flushed face fruity breath odor nausea vomiting or stomach pain"
1266,Type 1 Diabetes,Pregnancy and type 1 diabetes,"Pregnancy presents unique challenges for people who have type 1 diabetes. However, it’s possible to have a healthy pregnancy and baby despite having this condition. The most important thing to remember if you are expecting or trying to become pregnant and have type 1 diabetes is that everything you do for yourself, you do for your baby. People who have high blood sugar levels have babies with high blood sugar. According to theCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), high blood sugar levels during pregnancy can lead to complications such as: a high birth weight complicated cesarean delivery, commonly referred to as aC-section preterm birth low blood sugar high blood pressure stillbirth If you have type 1 diabetes and want to become pregnant or find out that you’re pregnant, talk with your doctor immediately. They can discuss any changes you may need to make to guarantee your blood sugar levels remain stable and safe for you and your baby. It’s best to plan ahead for pregnancy and discuss your diabetes and blood sugar goals with your doctor. During your pregnancy, you will likely need to see a healthcare professional more frequently. You may also need to adjust medication and insulin throughout the pregnancy."
1267,Type 1 Diabetes,Can you drink alcohol with T1D?,"Yes, you can drink alcohol if you live with type 1 diabetes. However, it’s important to know that alcohol canaffect your blood sugar levels in a big wayin the short term. Over time, excessive alcohol use can contribute to diabetes complications. The liver processes and removes alcohol from the body. The liver also helps manage blood sugar levels. If you have T1D and drink alcohol, your liver slows down how it manages blood sugar in order to address the alcohol in your system. This can lead to low blood sugar immediately and for several hours after drinking. It’s important to test your blood sugar before drinking alcohol and to continue to monitor it afterward."
1268,Type 1 Diabetes,What are type 1 diabetes complications?,"Over time, high blood sugar levels can cause damage to various parts of the body. Symptoms can include: increased heart attack risk eye problems, including blindness nerve damage infections on the skin, especially the feet, that could require amputation in serious cases kidney damage Diabetes can also damage your nerves and lead to a condition calleddiabetic neuropathy. This is common in the feet. Small cuts, especially on the bottom of your feet, can quickly turn into severe ulcers and infections, especially if blood sugar levels aren’t controlled. This is because you can’t feel or see the cuts, so you don’t treat them. That is why it’s important to check your feet regularly if you have diabetes. If you happen to notice any foot injuries, let your doctor know right away."
1269,Type 1 Diabetes,The takeaway,"Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune condition in which a person’s body is unable to process glucose due to a lack of insulin. Experts believe it is influenced by genetics, environmental factors, and possibly by viral infections. This condition requires insulin and daily blood sugar management, including balanced eating and an exercise routine. When monitoring blood sugars and overall management, you may also want to consider your mental health, sleeping patterns, and medications. You can lower your risk of long-term diabetes complications by keeping blood sugars and A1C levels in the target range. It’s important to consult with your doctor and healthcare team on managing diabetes and glucose levels regularly. Read this article in Spanish."
1270,Type 2 Diabetes,Overview,"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by high blood glucose levels, resulting from the body’s ineffective response to insulin or insufficient insulin production. Symptoms of type 2 diabetes can be mild initially, including constant hunger, lack of energy, fatigue, excessive thirst, frequent urination, blurry vision, and numbness in hands or feet, but can worsen over time. Type 2 diabetes can be managed and sometimes reversed through lifestyle changes; medication may be necessary for more severe cases. Typically, the hormoneinsulinhelps move glucose from your blood to your cells, where it’s used for energy. But withtype 2 diabetes, your body’s cells aren’t able to respond to insulin as well as they should. In later stages of the condition, your body may also not produce enough insulin."
1271,Type 2 Diabetes,Symptoms,"Type 2 diabetes can develop slowly. The symptoms may be mild and easy to dismiss at first. Theearly symptomsmay include: constant hunger a lack of energy fatigue excessive thirst frequent urination blurry vision pain, tingling, or numbness in your hands or feet As the disease progresses, the symptoms become more severe and can cause some potentially dangerous complications."
1272,Type 2 Diabetes,Causes,"Insulin is a naturally occurring hormone. Yourpancreasproduces it and releases it when you eat. Insulin helps transport glucose from your bloodstream to cells throughout your body, where it’s used for energy. If you have type 2 diabetes, your body becomesresistant to insulin. Your body is no longer using the hormone efficiently. This forces your pancreas to work harder to make more insulin. Over time, this candamage cells in your pancreas. Eventually, your pancreas may not be able to produce any insulin. If you don’t produce enough insulin or if your body doesn’t use it efficiently, glucose builds up in your bloodstream. This leaves your body’s cells starved for energy. Doctors don’t know exactly what triggers this series of events. It may have to do with cell dysfunction in the pancreas or with cell signaling and regulation. While the definitive trigger of type 2 diabetes is your body’s resistance to insulin, a combination of factors usually increases your risk of that resistance occurring."
1273,Type 2 Diabetes,Diagnosis,"Even if you do not have prediabetes, you should see your doctor right away if you think you may be experiencing symptoms of diabetes. Your doctor can get a lot of information from blood work.Diagnostic testingmay include the following: Hemoglobin A1C test:This testmeasures your average blood glucose levels for the previous 2 or 3 months. You don’t need to fast for this test, and your doctor can diagnose diabetes based on the results. It’s also called a glycosylated hemoglobin test. Fasting plasma glucose test:This test measures how much glucose is in your plasma. You may need tofast for 8 hoursbefore taking it. Oral glucose tolerance test:Duringthis test, your blood is drawn three times: before drinking a dose of glucose, 1 hour after, and 2 hours after. The test results show how well your body deals with glucose before and after the drink. If you have diabetes, your doctor will provide you with information about how to manage the disease, including: how to monitor blood glucose levels on your own dietary recommendations physical activity recommendations information about any medications that you need You may need to see anendocrinologistwho specializes in the treatment of diabetes. You’ll probably need to visit your doctor more often at first to make sure your treatment plan is working."
1274,Type 2 Diabetes,Treatment,"Type 2 diabetes can be managed and, in some cases, reversed. Most treatment plans will includechecking your blood glucose levels, and your doctor will let you know how often you should do it. The goal is to stay within a specific range. Additional lifestyle changes your doctor will likely advise to help treat your type 2 diabetes include: eating foods rich infiberandhealthy carbohydrates— eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains can helpkeep your blood glucose levels steady eating at regular intervals learning to listen to your body and know when you’re full managing your weight and keeping your heart healthy, which typically means keeping refined carbohydrates, sweets, and animal fats to a minimum getting about half an hour ofphysical activitydaily to help keep your heart healthy —exercisecan help to regulate blood glucose, too Not everyone with type 2 diabetes needs to use insulin. If you do, it’s because your pancreas isn’t making enough insulin on its own, and it’s crucial that you take insulin as your doctor prescribes. There are other prescription medications that may help as well."
1275,Type 2 Diabetes,Medications,"In some cases, lifestyle changes are enough to manage type 2 diabetes. If not, there are several medications that may help, including: Metformin:Thiscan lower your blood glucose levels and improve how your body responds to insulin. It’sthe first-line treatmentfor most people with type 2 diabetes. Sulfonylureas:These areoral medicationsthat help your bodymake more insulin. Meglitinides:These are fast-acting, short-duration medications that stimulate your pancreas to release more insulin. Thiazolidinediones:These make your body more sensitive to insulin. Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors:These are milder medications that help reduce blood glucose levels. Glucagon-like peptide-1 agonists:These slow digestion and improve blood glucose levels. Sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 (SGLT2) inhibitors:These help yourkidneysremove sugar in your body through urine. Each type of medication listed above can cause side effects. It may take some time for you and your doctor to find thebest medicationor combination of medications to treat your diabetes. If your body is unable to make enough insulin, you may needinsulin therapy. You may only need along-acting injectionyou can take at night, or you may need to take insulin several times per day."
1276,Type 2 Diabetes,Diet considerations,Diet is an important tool to help maintain optimalheart healthandblood glucose levels that are within a safe range. The diet recommended for people with type 2 diabetes isthe same diet that just about everyone should follow. It boils down to a few key actions: Choose a variety of foods that are high innutrientsand low inempty calories. Work on being mindful about portion sizes and stopping eating when you’re full. Readfood labelsclosely to understand the amount of sugar or carbs you could be ingesting in a serving size.
1277,Type 2 Diabetes,The takeaway,"Type 2 diabetes can be managed — and even reversed — with certain lifestyle changes. For more severe cases, medication is available. If you’ve been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, talk with your doctor about developing a treatment plan that works for your lifestyle. Because this condition is so common, there’s a plethora ofresourcesandfirst-person accountsto help you on your journey towards managing — or breaking free from — type 2 diabetes. Read this article in Spanish."
1278,Ulcerative Colitis,Overview,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a type of inflammatory bowel disease that causes inflammation and ulcers in the lining of your large intestine. It typically begins in the rectum and spreads to the colon. Common symptoms include abdominal and rectal pain, bloody stools, diarrhea, fever, weight loss, and malnutrition. Symptoms vary in severity among individuals and change over time between periods of remission and flare-ups. Treatment focuses on reducing inflammation to prevent flare-ups and achieve longer periods of remission. Options include medications like 5-ASA drugs, corticosteroids, and biologics. In severe cases that don’t respond to medical therapy, surgery may be necessary. UC is most common in people between15–30 years old, with a small increase in diagnosis between 50–70 years old. Read on to learn about UC, its symptoms, causes, and treatment."
1279,Ulcerative Colitis,What is ulcerative colitis?,"Colitis refers to inflammation of the inner lining of the colon. It causes symptoms such as abdominal pain, cramping, bloating, blood in the stool, and diarrhea. An inflamed colon can be caused by several conditions, one of which is ulcerative colitis (UC). This is a type of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which is a term referring to a group of diseases affecting the gastrointestinal (GI) tract. UC develops when the lining of the colon and rectum become inflamed. This creates ulcers on the colon’s lining, starting in the rectum and spreading upward, and can result in frequent bowel movements and discharge of mucus and pus. IBDshouldn’t be confusedwith irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), which also affects bowel movement, but this isn’t caused by inflammation of the GI tract. IBD also includes Crohn’s disease. The symptoms of UC and Crohn’s can overlap, but UC specifically affects the colon, whereas Crohn’s can cause inflammation anywhere in the GI tract."
1280,Ulcerative Colitis,Symptoms,"The seriousness of UC symptoms varies among people who have the condition. The symptoms can also change over time. People diagnosed with UC may experience periods of mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. This is called remission. However, symptoms can return and become severe. This is called a flare-up. Common symptoms of UC include: abdominal pain increased abdominal sounds bloody stools diarrhea fever rectal pain weight loss malnutrition UC may cause additional symptoms, such as: joint pain joint swelling nausea and decreased appetite skin problems mouth sores eye inflammation"
1281,Ulcerative Colitis,Causes and risks,"Researchers believe that UC may be the result of an overactive immune system. However, it’s unclear why some immune systems respond by attacking the large intestines and others don’t. Most people with UC don’t have a family history of the condition. However,about 8–14%of people with UC do have a family member with IBD. UC can develop in a person of any race, but it’s more common in white people. If you’re of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, you have a greater chance of developing the condition than most other groups. Other than your genes, factors that may play a role in who develops UC include other immune disorders you have and environmental factors like bacteria, viruses, or antigens that can trigger your immune system. Oral contraceptiveshave been foundto be associated with an increased risk of IBS."
1282,Ulcerative Colitis,Types of ulcerative colitis,"UC can be categorized according to the parts of the GI tract that it affects. Ulcerative proctitis:In ulcerative proctitis, only the rectum is inflamed. Left-sided colitis:Left-sided colitis causes inflammation in the area between the splenic flexure (near the upper part of the colon, where it bends) and the last section of the colon. The last section of the colon, known as the distal colon, includes the descending colon and sigmoid colon. Left-sided colitis is also known as distal ulcerative colitis.Proctosigmoiditis:Proctosigmoiditis is a form of left-sided colitis. It causes inflammation in the rectum and sigmoid colon. Proctosigmoiditis:Proctosigmoiditis is a form of left-sided colitis. It causes inflammation in the rectum and sigmoid colon. Extensive colitis:Extensive colitis, also known as pancolitis, causes inflammation past the left side of the colon, although it can include the entire colon. It’s considered a severe form of UC."
1283,Ulcerative Colitis,Diagnosis,"Different tests can help a doctor diagnose UC. It mimics other bowel diseases, such as Crohn’s disease. A doctor will order multiple tests to rule out other conditions. Tests to diagnose UC often include: Blood tests:Blood tests are often useful in the diagnosis of UC. A complete blood count looks for signs of anemia (a low red blood cell count). Other tests indicate inflammation, such as a high C-reactive protein level and a high sedimentation rate. A doctor may also order specialized antibody tests. Stool test:A doctor examines your stool for certain inflammatory markers, bacteria, and parasites. CT scan:This is a specialized X-ray of your abdomen and pelvis. Endoscopy:A doctor uses a flexible tube to examine your stomach, esophagus, and small intestine to determine whether it’s ulcerative colitis or Crohn’s. Biopsy:A surgeon removes a tissue sample from your colon for analysis. Flexible sigmoidoscopy:Flexible sigmoidoscopy is a type of endoscopy. During this test, a doctor inserts a long, flexible tube into your rectum so that they can examine it, the sigmoid colon, and part of the descending colon. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is also known as sigmoidoscopy. Colonoscopy:During a colonoscopy, a doctor inserts a lighted scope called a colonoscope into your rectum to examine the inside of your colon."
1284,Ulcerative Colitis,When to see a doctor,"If you’ve been diagnosed with UC, see a doctor if you experience symptoms such as: severe abdominal pain or cramping severe rectal bleeding chronic diarrhea that’s difficult to treat high fever swelling of areas such as the skin or joints dehydration These symptoms are sometimes associated with UC complications. If you haven’t been diagnosed with UC, see a doctor if you experience multiple symptoms of the condition. They can help determine whether you may have UC or another bowel disease."
1285,Ulcerative Colitis,Treatment,"UC is a chronic condition. Thegoal of treatmentis to reduce the inflammation that causes your symptoms to prevent flare-ups and have longer periods of remission. Which medication you’ll take will depend on your specific situation, including how severe your symptoms are. For mild symptoms, your doctor may prescribe a medication to reduce inflammation and swelling. This will help alleviate many symptoms. These types of medications include 5-aminosalicylates (5-ASA drugs) such as: mesalamine (Asacol HD, Lialda) sulfasalazine (Azulfidine) balsalazide (Colazal) olsalazine (Dipentum) Some people may need corticosteroids to help reduce inflammation, but these can have adverse effects, so doctors try to limit their use. If an infection is present, you may need antibiotics. If you have moderate to severe symptoms, a doctor may prescribe a type of medication known as abiologic. Biologics are made from antibodies, and help block inflammation. Taking these can help prevent a symptom flare-up. Effective options for most people include: adalimumab (Humira) golimumab (Simponi) infliximab (Remicade) ustekinumab (Stelara) vedolizumab (Entyvio) A doctor may also prescribe an immunomodulator. These change the way the immune system works. Examples include 5-ASA drugs. In 2018, theFood and Drug Administration (FDA)approved the use of tofacitinib (Xeljanz) as a treatment for UC. Initially used to treatrheumatoid arthritis, this medication targets cells responsible for inflammation. It’s the first oral medication approved for the long-term treatment of UC. If your symptoms are severe, you’ll need to be hospitalized to correct the effects of dehydration and loss of electrolytes that diarrhea causes. You may also need to replace blood and treat any other complications. Researchers continue to look for new treatments each year. Learn more about the newest UC treatments. Surgery is necessary if you experience: substantial blood loss chronic and debilitating symptoms perforation of your colon a severe blockage A CT scan or colonoscopy can detect these serious problems. Surgery is also recommended for severe infections or in patients who do not respond to medical therapy or have a high risk of cancer. Surgery typically involves removing your entire colon and rectum as well as creating a new pathway for waste. This pathway can be through a small opening in your abdominal wall. To redirect waste through your abdominal wall, the surgeon will make a small opening in the wall. The tip of your lower small intestine, or the ileum, is then brought to the skin’s surface. Waste will drain through the opening into a bag. This is called an ostomy bag. In other types of surgery, the surgeon removes the diseased part of your colon and rectum but retains the outer muscles of your rectum. The surgeon then attaches your small intestine to the rectum to form a small pouch. After this surgery, you’re able to pass stool through your rectum. Bowel movements will be more frequent and watery than normal. In certain procedures, the anus is also removed. Read more about each of the surgical options and their long-term effects."
1286,Ulcerative Colitis,Natural remedies,"Some of the medications prescribed to treat UC can have serious side effects. When traditional treatments are not well tolerated, some people turn to natural remedies to manage UC. Natural remedies that may help relieve UC symptoms include: Boswellia:This herb is found in the resin underneath Boswellia serrata tree bark.Researchsuggests it stops some of the chemical reactions in the body that can cause inflammation. Bromelain:This enzyme mixture is found naturally in pineapples, but it’s also sold as a supplement. It may help ease symptoms of UC and reduce flares. Probiotics:Your intestines and stomach are home to billions of bacteria. When the bacteria are healthy, your body can better ward off inflammation and symptoms of UC. Eating foods with probiotics or taking probiotic supplements can help boost the health of the microbial flora in your gut. Psyllium:This fiber supplement can help keep bowel movements regular. This may alleviate symptoms, prevent constipation, and make eliminating waste easier. However, many people with IBD can experience worsening abdominal cramping, gas, and bloating when they consume fiber during a flare-up. Turmeric:Thisgolden yellow spiceis chock-full of curcumin, an antioxidant that’s been shown to reduce inflammation. Keep in mind that these natural remedies have not undergone clinical trials and are not necessarily endorsed by professional organizations or their clinical guidelines. Many of these natural remedies can be used in conjunction with other UC treatments. Discover which ones might be safe for you and what questions you should ask your doctor."
1287,Ulcerative Colitis,Complications,"UC increases your risk of developingcolon cancer. The longer you have the disease, the higher your risk of this cancer. Because of this increased risk, your doctor will perform a colonoscopy and check for cancer 8 years after you receive your diagnosis. Repeat screeningsevery 1–3 yearsare recommended thereafter, according to the American Cancer Society. Regular screenings help lower your risk of colon cancer. Follow-up screenings can detect precancerous cells early. People living with left-sided UC or pancolitis may need to be screened every1–2 years. Other complications of UC include: thickening of the intestinal wall intestinal bleeding sepsis, or blood infection severe dehydration toxic megacolon, or a rapidly swelling colon rupture of your colon inflammation of your skin, joints, and eyes kidney stones Complications of UC are worse if the condition isn’t properly treated. Learn more about the complications of unmanaged UC."
1288,Ulcerative Colitis,Frequently asked questions,"If you have UC, a doctor will need to monitor your condition, and you’ll need to carefully follow your treatment plan throughout your life. The only true cure for UC is the removal of the entire colon and rectum. Your doctor will usually begin with medical therapy unless you have a severe complication that requires surgery. Some people will eventually require surgery. That said, UC is usually not a life threatening condition, and most people with it can live typical life spans. Serious complications such as a toxic megacolon or colon cancer areless commonbut can occur. There’s no solid evidence indicating that your diet affects whether you develop UC. That said, you may find that certain foods and drinks aggravate your symptoms when you have a flare-up, though. A fewgeneral rulesmay be useful for people trying to avoid a flare-up: Eat a low fat diet:It’s not clear why a low fat diet is beneficial, but it’s known that foods high in fat commonly cause diarrhea, especially in people with IBD. Eating more low fat foods may delay flare-ups. When you do eat fat, pick healthier options like olive oil and omega-3 fatty acids. Eat more fiber:During a flare-up, bulky, slow-moving fiber is the last thing you want in your intestines. During remission, however, fiber can help you stay regular. It may also improve how easily you can eliminate waste products during bowel movements. Discover the foods that are most likely to cause issues if you have UC. UC is not contagious. Some causes of colitis or inflammation in the colon can be contagious, though. That includes inflammation caused by bacteria and viruses. However, UC is not caused by anything that can be transmitted to another person. According to one study of IBD in the United States,1 in 1,299 children2–17 years old were affected by the condition in 2016. Crohn’s disease was twice as common as UC, and boys were more likely to have IBD than girls. Like adults, children with UCmay experiencebloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and cramping, and fatigue. They may also experience issues compounded by the condition, such as anemia, malnutrition, and weight loss."
1289,Ulcerative Colitis,Takeaway,"Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a form of inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) that causes inflammation in the lining of the colon and rectum. Common symptoms associated with UC include frequent bowel movements, as well as mucus and pus discharge with varying levels of severity. With proper treatment, most people manage the condition and live normal lives. Read this article in Spanish."
1290,Urinary Incontinence,Overview,"Urinary incontinence can be caused by weakened bladder muscles, damage to the pelvic floor, enlarged prostate, menopause, or bladder cancer. Some medications or neurological conditions can also cause urinary incontinence."
1291,Urinary Incontinence,What is urinary incontinence?,"Urinary incontinence happens when you lose control of yourbladder. In some cases, you may empty your bladder’s contents completely. In other cases, you may experience only minor leakage. The condition may be temporary or chronic, depending on its cause. According to theUrology Care Foundation, millions of adults in the United States experience urinary incontinence. Urinary incontinence affects women more often than men in a2-to-1ratio. However, this condition can affect anyone and has many different causes. As you age, the muscles supporting your bladder tend to weaken, which can lead to urinary incontinence. Many different health problems can also cause the condition. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and can be a sign of cancer, kidney stones, infection, or an enlarged prostate, among other causes. If you experience urinary incontinence, make an appointment with a healthcare professional. Urinary incontinence can interfere with your daily life and lead to potential accidents. A healthcare professional can also determine if a more serious medical condition may be the cause. They may also be able to treat the cause."
1292,Urinary Incontinence,Types of urinary incontinence,"Urinary incontinence is divided into three general types. You can potentially experience more than one type at the same time. Stress incontinenceis triggered by certain types of physical activity. For example, you might lose control of your bladder when you’re: exercising coughing sneezing laughing Such activities put stress on the sphincter muscle that holds urine in your bladder. The added stress can cause the muscle to release urine. Urge incontinence occurs when you lose control of your bladder after experiencing a sudden and strong urge to urinate. Once that urge hits, you may not be able to make it to the bathroom in time. Overflow incontinencecan occur if you don’t completely empty your bladder when you urinate. Later, some of the remaining urine may leak from your bladder. This type of incontinence is sometimes called “dribbling.” Unlike other types of incontinence,functional incontinenceis caused by physical or mental barriers that may prevent someone from making it to the bathroom in time. This can be due to cognitive issues, such as dementia or Alzheimer’s disease, muscular issues like arthritis, or neurological issues like stroke or spinal cord damage."
1293,Urinary Incontinence,Causes and risk factors of urinary incontinence,"There are many potential causes and risk factors for urinary incontinence. Some risk factors can include: having weakened bladder muscles, which can result from aging having physical damage to your pelvic floor muscles, such as from childbirth having anenlarged prostate having prostate or bladder cancer, which can put pressure on your bladder having a neurological condition such as dementia, Alzheimer’s, or a physical condition that may prevent you from making it to the bathroom on time having an infection, such as a urinary tract infection, bladder infection, kidney infection, or kidney stone being pregnant being overweight having diabetes going through menopause Some of the conditions that cause urinary incontinence are easily treatable and only cause temporary urinary problems. Others are more serious and persistent. Common causes of urinary incontinence may include: As you get older, the muscles supporting your bladder typically become weaker, which raises your risk for incontinence. To maintain strong muscles and a healthy bladder, it’s important to stay as active as you can, eat a diet rich in nutrients, and maintain a healthy weight. This may improve your chances of avoiding incontinence as you age. Your pelvic floor muscles support your bladder.Damage to these musclescan cause incontinence. It can be caused by certain types of surgery, such as ahysterectomy. It’s also a common result of pregnancy and childbirth. In men, theprostate glandsurrounds the neck of the bladder. This gland releases fluid that protects and nourishes your sperm. It tends to enlarge with age. It’s common for males to experience some incontinence as a result. Prostateorbladder cancercan cause incontinence. In some cases, treatments for cancer can also make it harder for you to control your bladder. Evenbenign tumorscan cause incontinence by blocking your flow of urine. Other potential causes of incontinence may include: constipation urinary tract infections (UTIs) kidneyorbladder stones prostatitis, or inflammation of your prostate interstitial cystitis, or a chronic condition that causes inflammation within your bladder side effects from certain medications, such asblood pressure drugs,muscle relaxants,sedatives, and some heart medications Some lifestyle factors can also cause temporary bouts of incontinence. For example, drinking too muchalcohol,caffeinated beverages, or other fluids can cause you to temporarily lose control of your bladder."
1294,Urinary Incontinence,When to seek medical help,"Any instance of incontinence is reason to seek medical help. It may be a symptom of a more serious condition that needs to be treated. Even if the underlying cause isn’t serious, incontinence can be a major disruption in your life. It’s important to get an accurate diagnosis and discuss treatment options with a healthcare professional. In some cases, incontinence can be a sign of a medical emergency. You should seek immediate medical attention if you lose control of your bladder and experience any of the following symptoms: trouble speaking or walking weaknessortinglingin any part of your body loss of vision confusion loss of consciousness loss of bowel control You can connect with a urologist in your area using theHealthline FindCare tool."
1295,Urinary Incontinence,Complications,"Urinary incontinence and treatment for urinary incontinence may result in complications, depending on the cause. These complications may include: Urinary tract infections.UTIs can be caused by wet undergarments against the skin. This may create an environment where bacteria can grow. Kidney damage.In some cases where the flow of urine is obstructed, you may experience kidney trouble or kidney failure. Cellulitis.This skin infection is caused by bacteria and may cause swelling and pain. Medication side effects.Medications used to control urinary incontinence may cause side effects, depending on the medication. Side effects may include dry mouth, nausea,hypertension, or others. Catheter side effects.If you have a catheter placed, you may experience side effects such as infection and trauma. Mental health side effects.Urinary incontinence may cause feelings of anxiety, depression, or social isolation."
1296,Urinary Incontinence,What to expect at your appointment,"During your appointment, your healthcare professional will likely ask questions about your symptoms. They’ll probably want to know how long you’ve been incontinent, which types of incontinence you’ve experienced, and other details. They may also ask about your daily habits, including your typical diet and any medications or supplements that you take. Depending on your symptoms and medical history, they may also order additional tests, including: Collecting a sample of urine for analysis.Laboratory staff can check theurine samplefor signs of infection or other problems. Measuring the amount of urine that you release when urinating, the amount left over in your bladder, and the pressure in your bladder.This information is gathered by inserting acatheter, or a small tube, into your urethra and your bladder. Conducting a cystoscopy. Duringthis test, they’ll insert a small camera into your bladder to examine it up close."
1297,Urinary Incontinence,What your treatment will involve,"Your healthcare professional’s recommended treatment plan will depend on the cause of your incontinence. An underlying medical condition may require medication, surgery, or other treatments. In certain situations, they may not be able to cure your bladder incontinence. In these cases, they will likely provide steps you can take to manage your condition. Treatment options for urinary incontinence may include: Bladder training.You may be encouraged to do certain exercises, such aspelvic floor exercisesor bladder training, which can help toincrease your bladder control. Behavior therapy.Managing your fluid intake, adjusting your diet, or using the bathroom at scheduled times before you feel the urge to go may help manage bladder incontinence, depending on the cause. Condition management.If your urinary incontinence is caused by another condition, such as constipation or a UTI, treating that condition may help your urinary incontinence as well. Medication.Sometimes, medication may help, depending on the cause of your bladder incontinence. Antimuscarinics are a class of drugs used to treat an overactive bladder. Catheter placement.If your urinary incontinence is persistent and significantly affecting your quality of life, a doctor may suggest an internal or externalcatheterto help manage overflow incontinence, or in some cases, functional incontinence. Weight loss.A doctor may suggest weight loss to help manage your symptoms because it can relieve pressure on your bladder. Absorbent undergarments.Using pads orabsorbent undergarments, from disposable panties to washable and reusable ones, may help contain smaller leaks. Reducing bathroom barriers.If you’re having trouble navigating to the bathroom, especially at night, consider maintaining a clear and well-lit path to help you get there as quickly as possible."
1298,Urinary Incontinence,Preventing urinary incontinence,"You can’t prevent all cases of urinary incontinence, but there are steps you can take to reduce your risk of developing it. For example, try to: maintain your healthy weight get plenty of exercise eat a balanced diet limit caffeine and alcohol consumption avoid smoking, if you smoke seek prompt treatment for urinary tract or bladder infections"
1299,Urinary Incontinence,The bottom line,"Urinary incontinence or bladder incontinence occurs when you lose control of your bladder. This may mean a minor leak or emptying your bladder or somewhere in between. This can be a temporary issue, such as one caused by an infection, or a more persistent one that may be caused by another health condition, such as an enlarged prostate or pelvic floor weakness. A doctor may be able to help treat your urinary incontinence by resolving the health issue that’s causing it. Or, they may be able to help you manage the condition through behavioral therapy, bladder training, medication, or other treatments. Even if the cause is not serious, urinary incontinence can affect your quality of life. It is important to talk with a doctor to discover the cause and find a treatment option that works for you."
1300,Vaccinations,Overview,"The immune system protects us against pathogens, which are microbes that cause infection. Vaccines “teach” the immune system to recognize and eliminate certain microbes. That way, your body is prepared if you’re ever exposed. Vaccinations are an important form of primary prevention. That means they can protect people from getting sick. Vaccinations have allowed us to control diseases that once threatened many lives, such as: measles polio tetanus whooping cough It’s important that as many people as possible get vaccinated. Vaccinations don’t just protect individuals. When enough people are vaccinated, it helps protect society."
1301,Vaccinations,Vaccination in children,"Vaccines are very important forinfants. But not all vaccines are given immediately after birth. Each vaccine is given on a timeline, and some require multiple doses. TheCenters for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)sets a recommended vaccine schedule for both children and adults, which is shown in the table below. If you didn’t receive some of your childhood vaccines, it’s still possible to get them as an adult. However, depending on the vaccine, the dosing schedule may be different. You can ask your doctor what to expect. Many vaccines are given in a group or series. It may seem like your child is getting a lot of vaccines all at once. But according to theCDC, there’s no data that supports spacing out childhood vaccines. In fact, delaying a child’s vaccinations can do more harm than good, leaving them vulnerable to pathogens that can cause serious illness or complications."
1302,Vaccinations,Vaccination in adults,"In addition to regular childhood vaccinations, adults should receive: shingles vaccine pneumococcal vaccine yearly influenza (flu) vaccine tetanus boosters COVID-19 vaccine Your doctor may also suggest you receive additional vaccines or boosters based on your sexual orientation, health history, personal hobbies, and other factors. These possible vaccines include: Bacterial meningococcal disease:This is a bacterial illness that causes inflammation of the layer of tissue surrounding your brain and spinal cord. While the meningococcal ACWY vaccine is recommended for all adolescents, the meningococcal B vaccine is alsorecommendedfor individuals with certain immune conditions. Yellow fever: This is a serious and potentially deadly viral disease that’s spread by mosquitoes. TheCDC recommendsanyone nine months and older be vaccinated against yellow fever if they plan to travel or live in areas of the world where yellow fever is present. Typhoid fever:This is a potentially dangerous infectious disease. TheCDC recommendsadults and children be vaccinated against typhoid before international travel to places where typhoid fever is common. Other vaccines you may need if you’re planning to travel are outlined by the CDC in itsTravel vaccine summary table."
1303,Vaccinations,How does vaccination work?,"A healthyimmune systemdefends against invaders. The immune system is composed of several types of cells. These cells defend against and remove harmfulpathogens. However, they first have to recognize that an invader is dangerous. When the immune system encounters anantigen, it starts an immune response. Proteins, toxins, and nucleic acids from pathogens are all examples of potential antigens. In response, the immune systemmakesantibodies, which are proteins that bind to specific antigens and neutralize them. It also leads to the expansion of antigen-specific immune cells called cytotoxic T cells, which find and destroy cells that have been infected with a pathogen. Vaccination, also known as immunization,teachesthe body to recognize new diseases by stimulating the body to make antigens for pathogens, priming the immune system to remember them. This allows for a faster response to the actual disease in the future, should you be exposed. Vaccines work by exposing you to a safe version of a disease. This can take the form of: a protein or sugar from a pathogen a dead or inactivated form of a pathogen a modified toxin (toxoid) from a pathogen a live but weakened form pathogen Vaccines are usually given by injection. Also, some vaccines require a booster dose. Boosters help to reinforce your defenses against illness."
1304,Vaccinations,Vaccination benefits,"When it comes to vaccination, these benefits are important to consider: Vaccines help prevent dangerous diseases that have killed and can sicken or kill many people. Researchers thoroughly investigate each vaccine before presenting the data to theFood and Drug Administration (FDA). The FDA can approve or deny the vaccine. The overwhelming majority of research shows that vaccines are safe. Vaccines protect people around you, especially people who are not well enough to be vaccinated. This occurs throughherd immunity. Widespread vaccinations make it less likely that a susceptible person will come into contact with someone who has a particular disease. Some vaccines, such as thehuman papillomavirus (HPV) vaccineandhepatitis B vaccine, can prevent infections that can cause cancer. Preventing illness from vaccine-preventable diseases can save both time and money. For example, it can reduce the number of sick days you need to take from work or school and can help you avoid unnecessary medical bills. Sometimes, vaccination can eliminate a disease entirely, such assmallpox. Additionally, polio has been almost been eradicated. According to theWorld Health Organization (WHO), wildpoliovirusonly impacted two countries in 2022 – Afghanistan and Pakistan."
1305,Vaccinations,Vaccine safety,"Vaccines are considered to be safe. They’re rigorously tested and go through many rounds of study, examination, and research before they’re used with the general public. TheCDCprovides information about how vaccine safety is ensured. It is possible to experience some side effects, but these are usually mild. Common side effects may include: pain, redness, or swelling at the injection site fever, with or without chills fatigue muscleorjointpain headache nauseaorvomiting diarrhea A 2021 study on the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine in a population found that89.8%of people experienced some pain at the injection site, 45.6% experienced headaches, 37.1% experienced muscle pain, and 33.9% experienced chills. Most mild vaccine side effects go away on their own within a few days. Some side effects, such as pain and fever,can be alleviatedthrough the use of over-the-counter medications likeacetaminophen(Tylenol) oribuprofen(Advil, Motrin) it is possible to experience an allergic reaction to a vaccine, though the CDCreportsthis is uncommon. Common symptoms may includehivesat the injection site andangioedema. In even rare cases, you could experience a serious allergic reaction calledanaphylaxis. Research shows the overall anaphylaxis rate for all vaccines is only1.31 per 1 million vaccine doses. Anaphylaxis is a severe reaction to a trigger, such as an allergy, and is potentially life threatening. Symptoms can come on quickly and include: feeling faint or lightheaded difficulty breathing or wheezing rapid heartbeat confusion anxiety clammy skin collapsing or losing consciousness hives swelling stomach pain, nausea, or vomiting If you or someone around you develops these symptoms, you should: Check to see whether they have an epinephrine pen. If they do, read and follow the instructions to dispense the medication. Dial 911 (or a local emergency number). Lay them down. If they have vomited, lay them on their side. Stay with them until emergency services arrive. It is possible for someone to need more than one injection with an epinephrine pen. If symptoms do not begin to clear after5 minutes, give a second injection if one is available. Another example ismyocarditis, which is an inflammation of the heart muscle and a rare side effect of COVID-19 mRNA vaccines. However, a2021 studyfound that the risk of myocarditis is actually higher in people who contractCOVID-19than it is in those who get an mRNA vaccine for COVID-19. Because most of the possible side effects are rare or relatively mild, the greatest risk for most individuals is choosingnot to get a vaccine. Not getting vaccinated can lead to infection, more severe illness, and transmission to others who may be vulnerable. It could also cause lasting complications or even be deadly. You may have more questions about the safety of vaccines.This guide to vaccine safety can help."
1306,Vaccinations,Vaccine effectiveness,"Generally speaking, vaccines are highly effective. However, no vaccine is 100 percent effective. The effectiveness rate for vaccines differs from one vaccine to the next. For example,flu vaccineseffectively lower the risk of infection by40-60%in people who get the shot. That may sound low, but keep in mind the flu vaccine is designed to match the strain of the flu scientists expect to be most abundant in the coming flu season. If they’re wrong, the vaccine may be less effective. If they’re right, the rate of protection may be higher. Themeasles vaccine,on the other hand, is97%effective when used as recommended. Indeed, most childhood vaccines are85-95%effective if administered properly, according to the WHO."
1307,Vaccinations,Why people don’t get vaccinated,"In recent years, vaccine opponents have challenged their safety and effectiveness. However, their arguments have generally been flawed. For instance, there’sno good evidencethat vaccination can cause Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). On the other hand, there is plenty of evidence of vaccine effectiveness. For example, vaccines prevent3.5-5 milliondeaths annually, according to the WHO. There are some other cases in which someone might not get vaccinated: Weakened immune system:In this case, you should not get live vaccines such as the MMR vaccine or thechickenpox (varicella) vaccine. However, other types of vaccines would still be generally safe. Previous allergic reaction:If you’ve had an allergic reaction to a vaccine before or you know you are allergic to an ingredient in the vaccine, you will need to avoid being immunized.Read more about which people should avoid certain vaccines and why. Lack of awareness:According to the CDC, only50.2%of American adults got the annual flu shot during the flu season of 2020 to 2021. A2017 survey studyof adults in the United States found that only 62.3% of respondents knew that there was a recommendation for the flu vaccine. Vaccine inequity:People from historically marginalized groupsmay haveless access to quality healthcare, including to vaccinations, than people who are white."
1308,Vaccinations,New and emerging vaccines,"New vaccines are being developed all of the time. The COVID-19 vaccines are a relatively recent example. These vaccines came about through a combination of building on previous research, an influx of private and public funding, and scientific collaboration. Learn more about thetypes of Covid vaccines available. Additionally, a new vaccine has been developed for malaria.Malariais a febrile illness that’s caused by a parasite carried by mosquitoes. According to theWHO, there were a total of 247 million malaria cases and 619,000 malaria deaths worldwide in 2021. The vaccine, called RTS,S/AS01, contains recombinant proteins from the malaria parasite. Based on the results of a pilot program, theWorld Health Organization (WHO) recommendedthe use of this vaccine in children that live in areas with high malaria transmission. Another intense area of research is in finding a vaccine forHIV. The high diversity of HIV and its high mutation rate are just two of the hurdles that have made this endeavor challenging. Many trials of potential HIV vaccines have been performed or are in progress. Some of thenewesttrialsinvolve the use of mRNA vaccine approaches similar to those used for the COVID-19 vaccines. Most recently, in 2022, emergency authorizationwas grantedfor Jynneos, a vaccine against Mpox (formerly known asmonkeypox)."
1309,Vaccinations,Vaccine ingredients,"Vaccines introduce your immune system to a pathogen so that you have protection from it, should you be exposed. Several types of vaccines arecurrently usedto accomplish this: Live virus vaccines:These use a weakened (attenuated) version of a pathogen. Killed (inactivated) vaccines: These are made from a pathogen that’s not living. Toxoid vaccines: These come from a harmful toxin that’s made by a pathogen. Toxoid vaccines don’t make you immune to the germ, but instead, they make you immune to the harmful effects of the toxin of a germ. Subunit, recombinant, polysaccharide, and conjugate vaccines:These take a structural component from a virus or bacterium that can train your immune system to attack this part of the germ. mRNA vaccines:These use a piece of mRNA to teach your cells to produce a protein from a pathogen that your immune system can then generate a response to Viral vector vaccines:These use a modified, non-replicating virus to show your cells how to make a protein from a pathogen that your immune system can then make a response to In addition to the actual antigen, other ingredients are used to keep vaccines safe during production, storage, and transportation. These ingredients may also help the vaccine work more effectively once it’s administered and represent a very small portion of the vaccine. They may include: Suspending fluid: Sterile water, saline, or other fluids keep the vaccine safe during production, storage, and use. Adjuvants or enhancers: These ingredients help make the vaccine more effective once it’s injected. Examples include aluminum gels or salts. Preservatives and stabilizers: Many vaccines are made months, even years before they’re used. These ingredients help prevent the antigen from breaking down and becoming ineffective. Examples of a stabilizer are monosodium glutamate (MSG) and thimerosal. Antibiotics: Very small amounts of a bacteria-fighting drug may be added to vaccines to prevent the growth of bacteria during vaccine production and storage. Each of these ingredients is studied rigorously for safety and efficiency.See how these ingredients work together in the flu vaccine. One vaccine ingredient that has been surrounded by a bit of controversy is thimerosal, a mercury-based preservative that iscurrently usedin the adult multi-dose flu vaccine. The ingredient has not been put into any childhood vaccines since 2001. However, its more widespread use in the past hascontributedto the false belief in a link between vaccines and autism spectrum disorder (ASD)."
1310,Vaccinations,Vaccination in pregnancy,"When you’re pregnant, vaccines don’t just protect you. They provide immunity to your growing baby. During these nine months, you and your baby need protection against serious diseases, and vaccines are a vital part of that. TheCDC recommendsthat people assigned female at birth planning to become pregnant receive an MMR vaccine before conceiving. These diseases, particularlyrubella, can lead to serious issues, including miscarriage and birth defects. Additionally, theCDC recommendspeople assigned female at birth also have certain vaccinations during their pregnancy. These include vaccines for whooping cough (Tdap), flu, and COVID-19. After pregnancy, people assigned female at birth can receive vaccines, even while breastfeeding or chestfeeding. Post-pregnancy vaccinations also help protect your infant. If you’re immune to a virus or bacterium, you’re less likely to share it with your child. If you aren’t properly vaccinated, you and your infant could get sick.Read why that’s a serious problem with the flu."
1311,Vaccinations,Vaccination cost,"Most health insurance plans cover vaccinations at little or no out-of-pocket cost to you. If you do not have insurance or your insurance does not cover vaccines, you can look for low- and no-cost alternatives. These include: Community health organizations:Many organizations provide vaccine clinics for infants and children at a greatly reduced rate. Vaccines for Children Program:This no-cost program provides recommended vaccines to children who do not have health insurance, are underinsured, are Medicaid-eligible, can’t afford the shots, or are Native Americans or Alaska Natives. State health departments: These community-based offices can provide basic health services, including vaccines, on a low cost basis. The CDC provides a routinely-updatedlist of vaccine costsso that consumers may have an idea of the out-of-pocket cost of a vaccine. If you do not have insurance and don’t qualify for any of these cost-reduction programs, this list may help you estimate your total out-of-pocket cost. Additionally, it’s important to know that COVID-19 vaccines are currentlyfree to the public. That means that anyone within the United States can receive a COVID-19 vaccine free of charge. Use thevaccines.gov search toolto find a COVID-19 vaccine or booster near you."
1312,Vaccinations,Vaccination statistics,"Vaccines are highly effective and safe. They’re used worldwide to prevent illness and death. These example statistics show how successful they’ve been — and how much more successful they could be with improved access. Polio:Cases have decreased bymore than 99 percentsince a polio eradication campaign was initiated in 1988, according to the WHO. Today, polio is routinely found in only two countries (Afghanistan and Pakistan). Prevention:Vaccines prevent4 to 5 million deathseach year. Another 1.5 million could be prevented with expanded vaccine access. Between 2000 and 2018, the worldwide rate of measles deaths fell by 73%. Rates:According to the CDC,68.3 percentof American children receive the 7-vaccine series that’s recommended by age two. However, most vaccination rates for individual vaccines are higher. COVID-19:By now, more than50 million Americanshave been vaccinated for Covid-19 and received an updated booster dose."
1313,Vaccinations,Takeaway,"Vaccines can reduce disease, and ending vaccination could be very dangerous. For example, In 2000, measles had been declared eradicated in the U.S. But, between the months of January and October of 2019, a total of 22 measles outbreaks comprising1,249 individual caseswere reported in the United States – the highest number of cases since 1992. Public health officials found that89%of people that contracted measles during this period were unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination status. Even today, around the world, many vaccine-preventable illnesses and deaths still occur. This is because vaccines are not available to everyone. Because vaccines can prevent millions of deaths each year, one of the missions of the WHO is to increase vaccine availability worldwide."
1314,Vaginal Infection,Overview,"Sometimes a vaginal infection has no symptoms. But other times, symptoms may include itching, changes in color or amount of discharge, and pain during urination. Vaginitis refers to a few different conditions that can cause infection or inflammation of your vagina. The similar umbrella termvulvovaginitisdescribes inflammation of both yourvaginaand your vulva, the external part of your genitals. Vaginal infections can have plenty of different causes, and they’re fairly common. In fact, theAmerican College of Obstetricians and Gynecologistssays up to a third of people with vaginas will develop vaginitis at some point in life. These infections can happen at any time, but they’re most common during your reproductive years, oryour late teens to early 40s. You can develop a vaginal infection without having penetrative sex, orany other type of sex. In other words, vaginitis isnotthe same as asexually transmitted infection (STI), though certain types of sexual activity can sometimes factor in — more details on that below. This article explores the main types of vaginitis, plus their symptoms, causes, and tips for getting treatment and relief."
1315,Vaginal Infection,Types of vaginal infections,"Vaginal infections share a lot of the same symptoms, which can make it harder to recognize exactly what’s going on. That said, each type of infection does involve a few unique symptoms: Bacterial vaginosis (BV).BVoften causes a thin grayish-white, greenish, or yellow discharge. This discharge can have a fish-like odor that tends to become stronger after penetrative vaginal sex. You may not notice much itching. Yeast infections.These commonly involve vaginal and vulval itching, soreness, and burning. Withyeast infections, you might also notice swelling in thelabia, or the folds of skin on the outside of your vagina. Any discharge will usually be white and lumpy, with a texture that some say resembles cottage cheese. Trichomoniasis.This infection typically causes both vaginal itching and a fish-like odor. Along with a greenish-yellow, frothy discharge, you might also notice swelling, irritation, and inflammation in your vagina and vulva. Other symptoms oftrichomoniasisinclude pain during vaginal sex, lower abdominal pain, and burning and pain during urination. Atrophic vaginitis.This isn’t an infection, exactly, but it can increase your chances of developing vaginal infections and UTIs. Withatrophic vaginitis, you might notice signs that resemble symptoms of other infections, like vaginal itching, burning, dryness, and changes in discharge."
1316,Vaginal Infection,General symptoms of vaginitis,"Vaginal infections don’t always cause noticeable symptoms. If you do develop symptoms, you’ll likely notice some of these common ones: vaginal itchingand burning vaginal soreness and discomfort inflamed, flushed, or swollen skin around your vagina and vulva a change in the amount ofvaginal discharge a change in thecolor of vaginal discharge pain or burning during urination pain during penetrative vaginal sex vaginal bleeding or spotting You might have just one or a few of the symptoms listed above. If your symptoms don’t go away within a few days or if they get worse, it’s important to contact a doctor or medical professional for diagnosis and treatment. If you have aurinary tract infection (UTI), you might also notice some of these symptoms, especially a painful or burning sensation while urinating."
1317,Vaginal Infection,How vaginal infections are treated,"Treatment for vaginal infections depend on the underlying cause of the infection. A doctor may prescribe: metronidazole(in tablet, cream, or gel form) orclindamycin(in cream or gel form) to treat a bacterial infection antifungalcreams orsuppositoriesto treat a yeast infection. You can also purchase yeast infection medications without a prescription at your local pharmacy or drugstore, but you’ll want to connect with a medical professional if the infection doesn’t go away or if it keeps coming back. metronidazole or tinidazole tablets to treat trichomoniasis estrogen creams or tablets to help treat severe vaginal dryness and irritation associated with atrophic vaginitis Medical professionals will usually also recommend avoiding irritants, such as strong or perfumed soap, scented tampons or pads, and douches."
1318,Vaginal Infection,Causes of vaginal infections,"In basic terms, vaginal infections tend to develop when something affects the usual balance of bacteria and yeast in your vagina. Here are the common causes of vaginal infections by infection type: Bacterial infections.An overgrowth of certain bacteria naturally found in your vagina can cause BV. While BV isn’t considered an STI, sexual contact — including hand-to-genital, oral, and penetrative vaginal sex — can lead to bacteria overgrowth and increase your chances of developing BV. Yeast infections.Yeast infections are usually caused by a fungus calledCandida albicans.Various factors, including antibiotics, hormonal changes, a compromised immune system, and stress, can all reduce the number of antifungal bacteria in your vagina, leading to an overgrowth of yeast. This overgrowth can cause symptoms of a yeast infection. Trichomoniasis.The protozoan parasiteTrichomonas vaginaliscauses this infection. Most people contract trichomoniasis by having vaginal, oral, or anal sex without an internal or external condom. Still, someevidencesuggests you can also contract it through shared bathwater. Other rare (but possible)methods of transmissioninclude damp toilet seats, pools, and shared towels or damp clothing. Vaginal atrophy.This condition generally develops aftermenopause, but it can also happen when you’re nursing or at any other time when you experience a drop in estrogen levels. Reduced hormone levels can cause vaginal thinning anddryness, which can lead to vaginal inflammation. Douching.Flushing your vagina with a mixture of water and vinegar, baking soda, iodine, or other antiseptic ingredients might seem like a good way to keep it clean. But the truth is that your vagina can keep itself clean.This practiceactually reduces healthy bacteria in your vagina, making infections more likely. Soap, body wash, and perfume.Washing your vagina with soap and body wash, or spraying it with perfume, can also disrupt itsnatural pH. While it’s absolutely OK to rinse your vulva and vagina with plain water, any other product or fragrance can kill healthy bacteria in your vagina and make infection more likely. Spermicidal contraceptives.Thismethod of birth controlmight come in gel, film, or suppository form. You insert it directly into your vagina, where it dissolves to kill sperm and prevent unwanted pregnancy. While spermicides work well for some people, they can lead to vaginal irritation and inflammation, and they can make vaginal infections more likely. Tight-fitting or synthetic clothing.Underwear and bottoms that can’t “breathe” can cause vaginal irritation by trapping moisture and preventing airflow, which can make infections more likely. Wearingvery tight bottoms, or leaving on wet bottoms after a workout or swim, can have a similar effect. Detergent and fabric softener.Noticed symptoms shortly after changing your laundry products? Scented detergent and fabric softener can also affect vaginal pH and contribute to yeast infections. In some cases, a medical professional might not be able to determine the cause of your vaginal infection. This condition is known as nonspecific vulvovaginitis. It can occur in people of any age, but it’s more common in young people who haven’t enteredpuberty."
1319,Vaginal Infection,How vaginal infections are diagnosed,"A doctor or medical clinician can help diagnose a vaginal infection. You can also use an at-homevaginal pH test, which you can find online or in some drugstores, to help identify a yeast infection or BV. If you regularly get vaginal infections, especially the same type of infection, a doctor or clinician may ask questions to help diagnose the infection and narrow down the cause. They might ask: about your health history, including any history of vaginal infections if you douche or wash your vagina with soap about your number of sexual partners whether you use condoms during vaginal sex if you use scented period products about symptoms of other health conditions Depending on your symptoms, they might also: perform apelvic examto look for irritation and inflammation collect a sample of vaginal discharge to send out for analysis swab your cervix to test forSTIs, like gonorrhea or chlamydia take a urine sample to test for other STIs"
1320,Vaginal Infection,Yeast infection vs. bacterial vaginosis,"Yeast infectionsandbacterial vaginosis (BV)share some symptoms, which makes it pretty easy to confuse one for the other. This can pose a problem when it comes to getting the right treatment. Yeast infections don’t always require professional medical treatment and can be treated with over-the-counter (OTC) products. BV, on the other hand,often requires treatment with antibiotics, which you can only get with a prescription. This chart can help youtell the two apart."
1321,Vaginal Infection,How to prevent vaginal infections,"Not all vaginal infections can be prevented, but these tips can help reduce your chances of developing one: Avoid using scented period products, including tampons, pads, and liners. Avoid douching, vaginal deodorants, and any scented sprays or perfumes on or in your vagina. Bathe in plain water only, since bubble bath and scented body washes can affect vaginal pH. Looking for vagina-friendly cleansers? Check outour guide. Wash sex toys after each use, according to their care instructions. Avoid sharing sex toysbefore cleaning them. Wearcotton underwear, or underwear with a cotton crotch, to help improve airflow and prevent vaginal irritation and inflammation. Change your underwear at least once each day, or after exercising. Stick to tights, leggings, pantyhose, and workout bottoms that have a cotton crotch. Change out of swimsuits and damp workout gear as soon as possible to help prevent excess moisture. Switch to an unscented detergent, or one designed for sensitive skin, and skip the perfumed fabric softener. Using condoms during sexcan also help lower your chances of developing a vaginal infection, even though vaginal infections aren’t considered STIs. Remember, condoms don’t just protect against STIs — they also help prevent changes in vaginal pH that could shift the balance of bacteria in your vagina. Here are a few things to keep in mind when choosing and using condoms: Avoid usingflavored condomsfor vaginal sex. Pre-lubricated or spermicidal condoms can cause irritation, too. Always use a new condom for vaginal penetration after anal sex. Looking for a new brand or type of condom? You’ll find a number of optionshere."
1322,Vaginal Infection,When to seek medical help,"Some vaginal infectionsmayclear up without treatment from a healthcare professional, especially when you help the infection on its way with home remedies or OTC medications. That said, infections won’t always improve on their own. You’ll want to make an appointment with your doctor or clinician if you: have never had a vaginal infection before had a vaginal infection in the past, but you’re having new or different symptoms have a vaginal pHabove 4.5 have symptoms that don’t improve with OTC treatment believe youcould have been exposed to an STI notice yellow or bloody discharge, or discharge with a foul odor have other symptoms, including vomiting, fever, or low back and stomach pain have difficulty urinating or need to urinate more than usual If you’ve had a yeast infection before and you recognize the signs, you might not need to make an appointment. You can often treat yeast infectionsat homewith OTC medications. That said, it never hurts to connect with a doctor or clinician if you get them often. They may be able to prescribe more effective treatment and help you narrow down the cause. You’ll also want to make an appointment if you have any doubts about the type of infection you have. It’s always recommended to get treatment from a doctor or clinician for any vaginal infection if you’re pregnant or believe you could be pregnant. Untreated vaginal infections can get worse, and some canlead to complications during pregnancy and delivery."
1323,Vaginal Infection,Outlook for people with vaginal infections,"While some vaginal infections clear up with home remedies, OTC treatments, and time, you can’t always treat a vaginal infection at home. Some infections require antibiotics or prescription antifungal medications. A medical professional can offer more guidance on finding an effective treatment and preventing future infections if you have: any new or concerning symptoms symptoms that don’t go away an infection that keeps coming back Untreated vaginal infections can cause plenty of discomfort, but they usually aren’t serious. Once you get the right diagnosis and treatment, they generally improve quickly. Crystal Raypole writes for Healthline and Psych Central.

1324,Vertigo,Overview,"Vertigo is a specific type of dizziness characterized by a false sensation of spinning or movement, distinct from general lightheadedness or motion sickness. Common causes include infections, Meniere’s disease, migraine, and head injuries, with treatment options varying based on the underlying cause. Management of vertigo often involves vestibular rehabilitation, repositioning maneuvers, medications, and home remedies. A doctor’s consultation is recommended for diagnosis and a tailored treatment plan. Vertigo is dizziness that creates the false sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving. The condition can feel similar tomotion sickness, but it’s not the same as lightheadedness."
1325,Vertigo,Types of vertigo,"There are two categories of vertigo: peripheral vertigo and central vertigo. Peripheral vertigo is themost commontype of vertigo. It occurs as a result of a problem in the inner ear, or the vestibular nerve, which controls balance. Read more about peripheral vertigo here. Central vertigo occurs as a result of a problem in the brain. It can becausedby a variety of different conditions, including: stroke brain tumor migraine traumatic brain injury infection multiple sclerosis"
1326,Vertigo,Causes,"Common causes for vertigoinclude: Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV).This is the most common cause of vertigo and creates an intense, brief sense that you’re spinning or moving. These episodes are triggered by a rapid change in head movement, such as a blow to the head. Infection.A viral infection of the vestibular nerve, calledvestibular neuritisorlabyrinthitis, can cause intense, constant vertigo. Meniere’s disease.When excessive fluid builds up in the inner ear, the result can besudden episodesof vertigo that last for several hours. Migraine.Migraine-induced vertigo can last minutes to hours. Head or neck injury.Vertigo is a common symptom after a traumatic injury to the head or neck, especially if there is damage to the vestibular system. Medications.Certain medications cancausevertigo, along with other symptoms like dizziness, hearing loss, andtinnitus, or a ringing in the ears. Although benign paroxysmal positional vertigo can be bothersome, it’s rarely serious, except when it increases the chance of falling. Symptoms mayinclude: dizziness a sense that you or your surroundings are spinning or moving a loss of balance or unsteadiness nausea vomiting Read more about benign positional vertigo here. Althoughstressdoesn’t cause vertigo directly, it can worsen it. What’s more,2016 researchsuggests that severe stress could increase your risk of stroke, which could potentially cause vertigo."
1327,Vertigo,Symptoms,"One of the most common symptoms of vertigo is dizziness, which usually worsens with head movement. It’s typically described by patients as a spinning sensation, with the room or objects around them seeming to move. Other symptoms of vertigoinclude: increasedsweating nausea vomiting headache ringing or buzzing in your ears hearing loss involuntary eye movements loss of balance"
1328,Vertigo,Treatment,"Treatment options for vertigo can depend on the underlying cause. To improve symptoms, vestibular rehabilitation therapy as well as medications, such asmeclizine (Antivert), have beenfoundto be effective. The canalith repositioning maneuver, also known as theEpley maneuver, is used torelievesymptoms of BPPV. These specific head maneuvers can help displace canalith crystals (small particles that can cause vertigo) from the canals of the inner ear. Each treatment session involves holding four positions for 30 to 60 seconds each and repeating each position several times, as needed. A healthcare professional can guide you through each movement during the session. They may also provide additional guidance on how to perform this procedure at home. Meclizineis an antihistamine, which is a class of medication often used to treatallergies. Meclizine is effective intreatingmotion sickness or vertigo. However, it might lead to confusion or evenamnesiain older adults. There are several exercises used to help alleviate symptoms of vertigo. They typically involve marching in place or holding specific positions to improve balance. These exercises are similar to the ones used in vestibular rehabilitation therapy (VRT). VRT involves exercisesdesignedaccording to each person and their symptoms. After a thorough clinical examination, one of three main methods is applied: habituation, which improves dizziness gaze stabilization, which improves control of eye movements so vision can be clear during head movement balance training, which improves steadiness However, if you have severe vertigo, it’s best to reach out to an experienced physical therapist for additional guidance, instead of performing these exercises on your own. Read more about exercises for vertigo here. Surgery may be necessary for the treatment of certain underlying conditions that can cause vertigo, such as a brain tumor orhead injury. There are several ways to naturally relieve discomfort caused by vertigo. For example, certain supplements can help improve sleep while dealing with vertigo, includingginkgo bilobaandmelatonin. There are also manyexercises for vertigothat youcan performat home, such asBrandt-Daroff exercises, theSemont maneuver, and the Foster maneuver. Read more about home remedies for vertigo here. Essential oilssuch as lavendermay helpstop dizziness and nausea. However, it’s important to keep in mind that there is currently no research available to support the use of essential oils for vertigo."
1329,Vertigo,Vertigo diagnosis,"A healthcare professional can diagnose vertigo by performing a clinical exam and collecting information about your symptoms and medical history. Certain clinical tests and observations can be helpful when assessing for vertigo. These include head impulse testing or theDix-Hallpike maneuver(patients are quickly lowered from a seated position to lying down). In some cases, additional testing may be needed to diagnose vertigo, including imaging, hearing exams, and balance tests."
1330,Vertigo,How long does vertigo last?,"The signs and symptoms of BPPV cancome and go, with symptoms commonly lasting less than a minute. In cases of Meniere’s disease, an episode of vertigo can last for longer than 20 minutes. Migraine-induced vertigo can last minutes to hours. Learn more about the duration of vertigo here."
1331,Vertigo,Vertigo vs. dizziness,"Although vertigo and dizziness are often confused, vertigo is typically described as feeling like the world is spinning, even when there is no movement. While dizziness is a more ambiguous term, patients will often interpret it as a sense of imbalance within their own space."
1332,Vertigo,Vertigo in pregnancy,"According to a2020 study, vertigo is the most commonly reported vestibular symptom during the first trimester of pregnancy. BPPV is particularly common duringpregnancy. According to 2017 research, which categorized participants as women and men, BPPV affects women more frequently than men with a ratio of2-to-1. Factors that can cause vertigo during pregnancy include: fluctuations in hormone levels prolonged bed rest changes in the metabolism of certain nutrients, includingvitamin Dandcalcium Many people also experiencedizziness during pregnancy. This could be caused by several factors, including unstable blood sugar levels. During the third trimester, the baby can put pressure on some of the major abdominal veins when the parent lies on their back, which can also cause dizziness."
1333,Vertigo,Is vertigo hereditary?,"In some cases, vertigo can be hereditary. Also known as familial benign recurrent vertigo, hereditary vertigo is a form of migrainous vertigo because it’s strongly associated with migraine attacks."
1334,Vertigo,Takeaway,"Vertigo can be caused by many factors, including infections, migraines, injuries, and several other health conditions. Treating the underlying cause of your vertigo is the most effective way to decrease discomfort and provide long-term relief. There are also many home remedies, exercises, and medications that may be beneficial. If you experience vertigo, it’s best to talk with a doctor to determine the cause and find a treatment plan that works for you.

1337,Yoga,The history of yoga and how its developed into the practice you know today,"By Dana Diament, aYoga Medicineinstructor based in Byron Bay, Australia. You can follow her journey atdanadiament.com. Ask any yoga practitioner to define yoga, and you’re likely to get a myriad of answers. For some, it’s a way to feel good in their bodies. For others, it’s a spiritual practice, and for many, a way of life. But regardless of your approach, yoga can help reshape and unravel your habitual or unconscious patterns. Practicing yoga helps provide a foundation and tools to building good habits, such as discipline, self-inquiry, and nonattachment. This exercise is also a pathway to empower you to make conscious choices to live a healthy and fulfilling life. Today, many agree that the word yuj — which yoga derives from — refers to greater internal states, such as clarity, peace, and happiness. One prevalent definition comes from “The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali,” compiled before 400 A.D. In the second verse of the first book, yoga is defined as the “cessation of mind wandering.” The sutras also provide an eight-limb system that guides the practitioner to transcend beyond the mind and attain yogic freedom. The eight-limb system is an integral and highly regarded part of yoga. Today, we practice asana, the physical postures, the most. These were developed in the early 20th century by Sri Tirumalai Krishnamacharya. Then, three of his most well-known students further developed particular styles of yoga, each with something different and beneficial to offer. Many styles practiced today have evolved from these three students, including Vinyasa yoga, where poses are linked with breathing to create a flowing, dynamic, and creative sequence. B. K. S.

1338,Yoga,Why you should practice yoga (or become an expert),"By Kaitlyn Hochart, aYoga Medicineinstructor based in San Diego, California. You can follow her journey at kaitlynhochart.com. We live in a culture where our minds and nervous systems are stimulated constantly. Yoga offers the space to slow your mind down and restore a sense of balance. In 2016, Yoga Journal and Yoga Alliance conducted a study calledYoga in America.They found that 36.7 million people were practicing yoga. That’s a 50 percent increase from 2012! It’s unclear what the direct cause is for this booming growth and rise in the popularity of yoga, but such interest may be attributed to the promising benefits that yoga and mindful practices offer. The most obvious benefit is, of course, physical. Yoga postures can help increase: flexibility strength mobility balance These benefitsare also why athletes practice yoga as part ofan effective cross-training regimen. During yoga, your body goes through a full range and variety of motion that can counteract aches and pains associated with tension or poor postural habits. Not only does yoga help you — and many athletes — become more aware of your body, it also allows you to fix these imbalances and improve overall athleticism. Another key benefit of yoga is that ithelps with stress. Accumulation of stress can cause your nervous system to be constantly in overdrive, making it difficult to unwind, focus, and sleep. The breathing exercises you practice during yoga can help lower your heart rate and shift your nervous system into a more relaxed state. It also promotes better sleep and increased focus. For people with a more spiritual background, the effects of practice start to be felt beyond the physical body and off the mat. Yoga can help connect you more deeply to your sense of purpose and awareness of living in the present. As you start your journey, what you get out of the practice can also change based on your needs. Practicing yoga can help with body awareness, flexibility, strength, mobility, and balance. It also requires you to shift into a more relaxed state, which can help decrease stress, increase focus, and promote a stronger connection with yourself."
1339,Yoga,Getting started with yoga,"By Alice Louise Blunden, aYoga Medicineinstructor based in London. You can follow her journey atalicelouiseyoga.com. Yoga isn’t one-size-fits-all, but it’s one of the few exercises that actually offers different “sizes” for people to try. If you’re new, it’s worth trying different styles to find which best resonates with you. Here’s a summary of the main types of yoga: Iyengar– This type is a combination of standing and seated postures using props for people who want to focus on alignment, posture, and gain increased muscular power and range of motion. Viniyoga– A class that’s focused on breathing and meditation for people with limited mobility or who want to work from the inside out, to experience relaxation, body awareness, and better posture. Jivanmukti– A set sequence that incorporates meditation, compassion, chanting, and deep listening, for people whowant to incorporate spiritual elements and ancient teachings of yoga in their practice while gaining body awareness, learning Sanskrit, and improving relationships. Hatha– This type uses yoga poses and breathing techniques to align and calm the body, mind, and spirit in preparation for meditation. Classes are slower paced, but holding the poses can be more physically demanding. Vinyasa– This dynamic type synchronizes movement with breath and may be referred to as a “flow class.” Expect to move faster than in a traditional Hatha class. Ashtanga– Ashtanga goes through a fast-paced and physically challenging sequence of poses practiced in the same order with a strong emphasis on the breath. In traditional classes, you aren’t meant to drink water and can only move onto the next pose or series after you’ve achieved the last. Bikram– Bikram consists of two breathing techniques and 26 poses repeated in the same order for 90 minutes. It’s often practiced in a room heated to 105°F (40.6°C) to help sweat out toxins. Kundalini– This type incorporates repeated movements (referred to as a “kriya”), dynamic breathing, mantras, chanting, and meditation. It’s believed to awaken the energy at the base of the spine and draw it upward through the chakras. Yin– Poses are held for 3-5 minutes, mainly in a lying down or seated position. The longer stretches aim to release tension and restore range of motion to muscles and connective tissue. It’s helpful for people who have tight muscles, stress, or chronic pain. Restorative– Very gentle poses are held for 10 minutes or more. Includes plenty of props for support and relaxation, such as blankets, bolsters, and straps. Similar to Yin yoga, this is a helpful practice for people living with chronic pain or anyone feeling stressed. Through different styles of yoga, you’ll notice a common, consistent theme: self-healing. Whether you choose to practice Yin or prefer Vinyasa, practicing any style of yoga gives you the opportunity to turn inward and learn more about yourself so that you can be of greater service to the people and the world around you. It can be helpful to familiarize yourself with some of the main foundational poses that most physical practices use. Check out this list of poses with alignment cues that you can practice in the comfort of your own home. Downward-Facing Dog Come onto your hands and knees. Straighten your arms and relax your upper back between the shoulder blades. Keeping your knees bent, lengthen your knees and lift your hips high. Your aim here is to form the shape of an upside-down “V.” If you have the flexibility in your hamstring muscles, straighten your legs and let your heels drop down toward the floor while maintaining the length in your spine. If you notice your spine start to curve as you straighten your legs, bend your knees enough so that you can keep the spine long. Hold for 5 breaths. Cobra Lie on your stomach with your legs straight. Firm up the muscles in your legs and have your feet hip-width apart and your toes pointing behind you. Push down through your pubic bone to avoid collapsing into the lower portion of the spine. Place your weight onto your forearms as you lift your chest away from the ground. Make sure that your neck is long as you look straight ahead. Hold for 5 breaths. Warrior I Stand up straight and step your right foot back. Keep your front foot pointing straight forward and position your back foot at approximately a 45-degree angle. Position your feet hip-width apart so you’re able to square your hips to the front of the mat. Bend into your front knee. Make sure your knee is directly above your ankle, or behind it. Keep your back leg strong. Raise your arms up straight above your head and relax your shoulders. Hold for 5 breaths before switching to the other side. Warrior II Stand up straight. Step your right foot back. Keep your front foot pointing straight forward. Position your back foot at a little less than a 90-degree angle. Align your front heel with the arch of your back foot. Have your hips turned toward the side of the mat. Bend into your front knee so your knee is directly above your ankle, or behind it, ensuring the kneecap is tracking over the middle toe. Keep your back leg strong. Raise your arms up parallel with the ground. Relax your shoulders. Hold for 5 breaths before coming to the other side. Tree Pose Stand up straight. Shift your weight onto the left foot, keeping the inner part of your left foot firmly on the floor, and bend your right knee. Draw your right foot up and place the sole against your inner left thigh, inner calf muscle, or inner ankle with your toes touching the floor. Place your hands on the top rim of your pelvis to make sure that it’s parallel to the floor. Lengthen your tailbone toward the floor. Firmly press the sole of the right foot against the inner thigh, calf, or ankle, and resist with the outer left leg. Raise your arms straight above your head. Ensure that you keep your shoulders relaxed. Hold for 5 breaths before changing to the other side. Seated Forward Fold Sit on the ground with your legs straight out in front of you.

Hold for 5 breaths before coming to the other side. Cat-Cow Get on your hands and knees. Your wrists should be underneath your shoulders and your knees underneath your hips. Balance your weight evenly on all fours. Inhale and look up, letting your stomach point down towards the mat. Then exhale and tuck your chin into your chest, curving your spin up towards the ceiling. Be awareness of your body and your breath as repeat these movements. Continue this fluid movement for 5 breaths. Controlling your breath is an integral part of yoga. The formal name for this practice is pranayama. “Prana” can be explained as life force, energy, or qi, while “ayama” is the Sanskrit word for extension. Here are some of the basic pranayama practices to start you off in your yoga journey: Ujjayi pranayama Ujjayi pranayama is most commonly used in Ashtanga and Vinyasa yoga. An ocean sound is created with this breathing technique by contracting the epiglottis, the leaf-shaped flap of cartilage located behind the tongue at the top of the voice box. This sound aims to anchor the mind during your practice. Ujjayi technique: Breath in and out through your nose. Breathe in for 4 counts and breathe out for 4 counts. Complete 4 rounds of this. On your fifth breath, slowly breathe in through your mouth, as if you were sipping through a straw but with your mouth closed. As you breathe out, see if you can slowly exhale, as if you were steaming up a mirror but with your mouth closed. Continue this breathing all the way through your yoga practice. Nadi Shodhanam pranayama Nadi Shodhanam refers to alternate nostril breathing to slow down inhalation and the exhalation. This technique balances the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system to cultivate a state of internal tranquility, stability, and peace of mind, while balancing and regulating energy through the left and right side of the body. Nadi Shodhanam technique: Find a comfortable seat on the ground or on a chair. You can also be standing still or lying down. Close your eyes and take a couple of deep breaths in and out through your nose. Using your thumb on your right hand, close your right nostril. Inhale through your left nostril for 5 counts, then remove your thumb. Using a different finger on your right hand, close your left nostril and exhale through your right nostril for 5 counts. Now switch, inhaling through your right nostril for 5 counts and exhaling through your left. Repeat for 3 to 9 rounds. Viloma pranayama This breathing technique aims to calm the brain and your nervous system. It can be practiced at the start or end of your yoga practice, or on its own. Viloma technique: Lie down, or sit comfortably. Place one hand on your belly and the other hand on your heart. Close your eyes. Take a couple of deep breaths in and out through your nose. On your next inhalation, sip in a third of the breath through your lips, like you’re drinking from a straw, into your belly and pause for a moment. Sip a third more into your side ribs and pause for another moment. Sip the final third of your breath into your chest. Exhale slowly through your nose. Repeat for 3 to 9 rounds. Both mindfulness and meditation are integral parts of the yoga practice. As mentioned earlier, physical yoga practices aim to prepare the body and mind for meditation. There are two simple elements that define mindfulness: Become aware of the physical sensations in your body. Notice these sensations without judgment. Below is a simple, mindful counting meditation that you can practice at home: Meditation technique Find a comfortable seat. Set a timer for how long you’d like to meditate for, somewhere between 5 to 10 minutes. Close your eyes. Notice the sounds around you. Listen as they come and go. Bring your awareness to your physical body. Can you notice the temperature of your skin? Can you notice what’s touching your skin? Focus the awareness from your head and move down to your feet. Which parts of your body are harder to notice? Which parts of your body are easier? Bring your awareness to your breath. Notice the cool air as you breathe in and the warm air as you breathe out. Start to count your breath. Inhale on 1 and exhale on 2. Continue counting all the way up to 10. Repeat until the end of your meditation. Studio classes Self-practice"
1340,Yoga,What to expect as a beginner,"By Kaitlyn Hochart, aYoga Medicineinstructor based in San Diego, California. You can follow her journey at kaitlynhochart.com. The start of any new activity can be met with a combination of excitement and nervousness, and starting yoga practice anew is no different. To help you feel more at ease, this section will cover options of where to begin practicing yoga, what to expect in class, and suggestions for progressing your practice to the next level. Just as there are a wide variety of yoga styles, there are numerous options where yoga classes are offered. Find a practice space that’s easy to get to and offers classes that fit your schedule. Common settings include: neighborhood yoga studios gyms and athletic clubs integrative health practices, like physical therapy offices, chiropractic offices, etc. workplace and corporate yoga online yoga programs and websites private yoga instructors seasonal, donation-based outdoor yoga events Set a goal to make one to two classes per week for the first few months of your practice. With this consistency, the poses and flow of the class will become more familiar. You’ll start to notice the physical and mental benefits of the practice. Many studios have beginner classes and fundamental workshops. These offerings are wonderful for beginner and advanced students alike. They’re often slower paced, and focus more attention on alignment and how to safely get into the poses. Bring your yoga mat and water. For warmer classes, you might want to bring a towel, too. Most studios are usually well-equipped with yoga props such as blocks, blankets, straps, and bolsters, but you may want to call ahead or check online to be sure. A common reservation for beginners is working with injuries and a lack of familiarity with the poses. If this is a concern, you can work privately with an instructor before entering group classes. Just a few individual sessions can provide the foundation and confidence you need to modify poses or work around your injury. The typical length of a group class is 60, 75, or 90 minutes. The teacher will guide you through breathing and moving your body into the poses. Some teachers may even demonstrate the poses, although larger classes tend to rely on verbal cues. Yoga classes end with several minutes of lying down on your back with your eyes closed in a pose called Savasana. It’s a time to let your body and breathing completely relax. Savasana is an opportunity to feel the physical effects of the practice integrate into your body. After Savasana, the word “namaste” is said by the teacher, and the students repeat. Namaste is a word of gratitude and a gesture of thanking the teacher and students for coming to practice. Always feel free to talk with your teacher after class if you have specific questions about certain poses and how you can make them more accessible for your body. Repetition and consistency are the keys to moving forward. After you’ve found a style, teacher, and location that works for you, try these tips: Begin a home practice once you feel comfortable in the foundational yoga poses. Attend local workshops where teachers can break down certain aspects of the yoga practice in more detail. Notice the effects a consistent yoga practice has on you by observing how your body feels, and how interactions and relationships outside of your yoga practice feel. Take note on how you feel during times away from practice. This can help you recognize yoga’s benefits more. The positive effects will highlight the value of the practice and serve as motivation to keep returning to your mat. If you’re a newcomer to yoga, it’d be ideal to take a few classes before starting at home. A teacher can help make sure you’re not doing yoga incorrectly and building bad form. Once you feel comfortable, you can then transition to working out at home."
1341,Yoga,Moving on to the intermediate stage,"By Rachel Land, aYoga Medicineinstructor based in Queenstown, New Zealand. You can follow her journey atrachelland.yoga. By now, things that may have seemed impossible in your first class might now be within your grasp. You’ve heard about the benefits of yoga, and experienced moments of calm and clarity that make them feel a little more believable. To advance further, here are some qualities to continue building that’ll help you advance your yoga journey. One of the qualities that separates a serious yogi from a beginner is consistent and dedicated practice. Two of the core concepts of yoga philosophy reinforce this: Tapas, or burning enthusiasm.Tapas means to heat, shine, or purify. Yogis believe that the fiery effort of tapas, stoked through disciplined yoga practice, burns off lethargy and impurity, transforming you into your best and highest self. Abhyāsa, or regular and diligent practice over the long haul.In the same way athletes train to meet the challenges of their sport, yogis continue to show up on their mats. Now that you know what style you enjoy, commit to regular practice. A yoga studio membership, online subscription, or even making regular yoga dates with a friend will help. Aim to practice three times a week. It’s time to look beyond the basics of the pose and into nuanced cues, like: “Lift the arches of the feet.” “Lengthen the skin over the sacrum.” “Engage mula bandha.” Instructions that didn’t make sense to you as a beginner are now ready to be explored. To progress in your practice, cultivate more body awareness. Instead of copying your teacher, develop a rich internal sense of how and where your body is positioned in space. Study the details, from meditation method and pranayama (breath work) to mudra (hand gestures) and mantra (sacred sounds). Look beyond a purely physical experience of yoga to explore its mental, emotional, and energetic effects. Notice the details and practice the subtle cues to build strength. As aspects of practice become more familiar, you can begin to develop what yogis call “drishti,” or focus and concentrated intention. With continued focus, more and more time will pass between periods of distraction. Your practice will start to generate a feeling of clarity and calm. Lose yourself in the fine details of the practice. Try to string postures along the ribbon of your breath, like pearls on a string. As you continue to practice, see if you can find a difference between yoga days and non-yoga days. Focus on the positive, such as feeling calmer or a boost in energy and mood. Each positive experience you associate with being on your mat will make it easier to commit to coming back again. You want the benefits you’ve noticed to last, for every day to feel like a yoga day. If you feel confident in your practice, it may also be the time to initiate a home yoga practice. No matter how short or simple, a regular — even daily — home practice is the stepping-stone to making the physical and mental changes you’ve noticed more permanent. If you’re short on inspiration, consider a private yoga session with a respected teacher, delve into yoga history and literature, or attend a workshop on a topic that intrigues you. The ancient practice of yoga offers countless pathways to real and concrete benefits. Now it’s up to you to find your way. Build a foundation of good habits, such as diligence and consistency, to help bring your beginner mindset into the next stage. In the intermediate stage, you can focus on building strength and more nuanced moves."
1342,Yoga,Entering the pro — or advanced — stage of yoga,"ByDana Diament, aYoga Medicineinstructor based in Byron Bay, Australia. You can follow her journey atwww.danadiament.com. Being an advanced practitioner is less about doing advanced poses — although your body may certainly be ready for those — and more about deepening your commitment to practice on and off the mat. Advanced practitioners usually practice four to six times per week. At this stage, we also recommend expanding the range of your practice to include both active and restorative asana, pranayama, and meditation. If it appeals to you, mudra and mantra can also be a way to add richness to your practice. The style and duration of practice will vary depending on what you feel you need the most that day. At this stage, your ability to maintain focus on your breathing and internal states throughout practice allows you to quickly tap into the depth of your practice. This means a shorter practice can be just as potent. You can still enjoy practicing regularly with a teacher or with a class. But you’ll also want to commit to practicing at home in a dedicated space, such as a corner of your living room or bedroom. less distractions moving with your breath tailoring the practice to what you need that day lingering on the parts of the practice that you personally find challenging incorporating poses that are most useful for your well-being connecting to your intuition Some advanced yogis practice at home a majority of the time. Others maintain a more even balance between home practice and public group classes. As you progress, this will become a matter of your personal preference. At the advanced stage, it’s important to develop a richly nuanced internal experience through self-inquiry and interoception. The practice of self-inquiry is known as swadhyaya, and is one of the niyamas, or moral practices, from Patanjali’s eight-limbs. This can help you uncover a deeper understanding of your mind, habits, and reactions. Interoception is the ability to sense what’s happening within your body and paying close attention to what you feel without trying to fix anything or judge what’s happening. With this heightened awareness, you’ll be able to extract tremendous benefit from the simplest of sequences and poses. Focus on yourself and be introspective as you practice. This way you can build the ability to sense what’s happening in and to your body. Transition what you learn from yoga “off the mat.” Off the mat is a term yogis use to mean your everyday life. Some ways to take your yoga off the mat include: Incorporate the yamas and niyamas.For example, be content with results (santosha), be truthful with your words (satya), maintain orderliness in your surroundings (saucha), and be generous with your time or money (aparigraha). Summon the focus you’ve developed in your practice throughout your day.Do this at work, at home, with loved ones, or in other hobbies and sports. Notice what disturbs your calmness during your day, as well as your habitual reactions to these triggers.Apply this awareness to help you make more suitable choices. Use your improved interoception to take better care of your health.This also allows for you to communicate more clearly with your healthcare providers. One of the more rewarding signs of being an advanced practitioner is the staying power of the benefits. After you’ve accumulated practice hours under your belt and found ways to connect the practice into your life, you’ll feel your yoga practice’s positive influence — even on days when you have a short practice or no practice at all. Advanced yoga is about bringing what you’ve learned off the mat and into your everyday life. Many yoga practitioners at this stage also immerse themselves even further and attend week or monthlong retreats or teacher trainings."
1343,Yoga,What do the experts say about yoga?,"ByAlice Louise Blunden, aYoga Medicineinstructor based in London. You can follow her journey atalicelouiseyoga.com. In this next section, we interviewed eight experts (four internationally renowned yoga teachers and four medical professionals) to find out how practicing yoga has: affected their lives introduced benefits changed since they started as beginners They also included any advice you might need to know as a new student or someone with any potential medical concerns or injuries. Interviews have been edited for clarity and brevity. Why do you choose to practice yoga? Yoga is a game-changer for me. Some days it allows me to show up efficiently and with clarity, some days it helps me to be a better person, some days it allows me to just be and not worry about all the chaos around me. Yoga used to be more of a physical practice for me — and some days it still is — but most of all, it helps me show up better in my life. My practice is my tool to create what I need, whether that’s exercise, therapy, or peace of mind. What’s your greatest piece of advice for people new to yoga? Keep taking classes until you find a teacher who lights you up, who moves you to be a better human off the mat. That’s your teacher. Why do you choose to practice yoga? My reason to practice yoga has morphed throughout the years — because it’s fun, I love to sweat, I adore the challenge, I need to reset, I have to calm down — to the current need to move stagnant energy and emotions out of my body. That’s such a huge slice of why yoga is so amazing. It is the ultimate reinventress and open to all of our whims. Which type of yoga practice is the least helpful for someone’s health? Anything that hurts! If it causes physical pain or mental anguish, back off a bit or back away completely. I’m always a little hesitant to recommend Ashtanga yoga because it requires a lot of flexibility and many poses put a lot of weight on the shoulders. A heated practice to anyone with heat sensitivity or multiple sclerosis can worsen these conditions and put people at risk of injury. If you have anxiety, avoid any pranayama techniques involving breath retention or short breaths that could trigger somatic sensations that feel like anxiety or even a panic attack. Is there harm in practicing yoga? People experiencing acute injury or trauma should switch to a restorative yoga practice. Poses that involve inverting the body or part of the body carry the most potential harm when practicing yoga asana. If you have untreated hypertension, migraine headaches, glaucoma, a detached retina or other eye problems, cardiac problems, vertigo, and are menstruating, you should avoid inversion poses. Prone positions and twisting poses strongly contract or put pressure on the abdomen or pelvis, which may be harmful during menstruation. As a doctor, which type of yoga practice could be most helpful for someone’s health? I believe that Yin and restorative yoga would be of most benefit for those who are starting out and for those who are physically weaker. For those that are physically fit, I would recommend Hatha or Vinyasa. For someone who is new to yoga, Ashtanga or Bikram may cause unintended, harmful side effects. In your opinion, how is yoga perceived in the medical world? In the medical world, yoga is primarily thought of as a safe, healthy form of physical fitness. The mental and emotional resilience that yoga practice builds is usually overlooked. The immense spiritual benefit of yoga is rarely considered in the medical world, which primarily has a secular focus."
1344,Yoga,What you need to get started,"By Cristina M. Kuhn, aYoga Medicineinstructor who splits her time between Washington, D.C., and Barbados. The great thing about yoga is that you don’t need much in terms of “gear” to get started. Willingness to take that first step is really the first tool. You must make the choice to attend to your own health and well-being, and then once you’ve done so, you can begin to add additional layers as you need them. You may never need or even want a full yoga wardrobe or prop closet — and that’s just fine! What you wear is really important. You’ll need comfortable clothing that you can move in, whether it’s yoga pants or running shorts. You may already own something, or you may need to buy new clothes. New clothes can range from $5 to $100 or more, so choose an option that fits into your budget and that you feel most comfortable in. Yoga pants: 90 Degree by Reflex, $16.00-34.99 Tanks: icyZone Activewear, $8.99-18.99 Mat: BalanceFrom GoYoga, $17.95 Set of blocks: Reehut Yoga Block, $6.98-10.99 Strap: Reehut Fitness Exercise Yoga Strap, $4.98-7.89 Bolster: YogaAccessories, $39.99 Yoga mat:Many people choose to purchase their own mat rather than borrow or rent at a local studio, which can range from $2 to $10. Prices for your own mat can range from $15 to $200. And you get what you pay for, so we suggest aiming for a quality mat that’s in the $40 to $60 range. (For example, people with sensitive knees or backs may want a thicker mat.) Props and other gear:Most yoga studios will supply all of the other props you may need, like yoga blocks, straps, and blankets. Some may even provide bolsters, sandbags, and eye pillows. If you’re practicing at home, you don’thaveto buy these props, either. Owning a mat, a set of blocks, and a strap can help support and ease you into your practice, but you can use the carpet as your mat, household items as blocks, and towels as straps, too. Here’s a breakdown for average class costs: Studio package or membership.Approximately $100 to $200 per month. Gym membership.Approximately $58 to $100 per month. Online yoga membership.Approximately $60 to $150 per year. Private session(s).Varies based on the instructor. While it’s certainly less expensive to practice yoga at home, new yogis may find it beneficial to begin with a group class or by scheduling a private yoga session. The guidance and feedback a teacher provides on the spot is invaluable. You just can’t get that same experience from an online video or book. Many yoga studios offer session and class packages. The cost ranges depending on where you live and what package you’re looking for. The initial investment is a lot more than paying per class, but often these packages give you a discount on the per-session or per-class investment. Packages are a good idea if you want to try a new studio, or if you want to commit to attending class regularly. Some studio memberships can provide extra perks, as well as reduce your per-class investment. If your local yoga studio’s rates are out of your price range, check gyms and community centers. They often offer budget-friendly options. Some gyms may also allow you to attend classes for no additional cost. There’s plenty of resources for home practice, too. Try an online yoga website with experienced teachers likeYogaGloorYoga International. These sites are a great option if you feel more comfortable working at home, are limited by time, or want to be able to choose exactly the kind of class you need that day. A private session may be more expensive, but it also has the benefit of providing focused attention and addressing specific needs or injuries. For group classes, you can contact the studio, gym, or teacher to ask which classes they recommend for you. Contact your local yoga studios to see if they offer sessions, class packages, or discounted deals for new yogis. If the studios are still out of your price range, you can also look at community centers and gyms. Low budget: It’s possible to do yoga entirely for free! Follow online videos and use household items as props. Wear comfortable clothing you already own and that you can move easily in. But remember, for every great yoga video on YouTube, there are hundreds or thousands that aren’t so great. Choose wisely by looking at reviews, views, and into the background of the trainer featured in the video.Check out our top picks for yoga videos to get you started. Moderate budget: Purchase a yoga mat and attend classes at your gym, community center, or through an online yoga subscription site. If your cash flow allows it, you can purchase a multi-class package or a membership at a yoga studio to maximize the bang for your buck. Consider making a purchase of two or three pieces of clothing designated for yoga practice. Large budget: Purchase a yoga mat, two blocks, a strap, and a bolster for your home practice. Schedule private sessions with a highly recommended teacher (or check out Yoga Medicine’s “Find a Teacher” resource for guidance), then begin to layer on group classes. Consider becoming a member at your favorite studio. Invest in a yoga wardrobe that moves with you and brings you joy! Don’t feel like you need to rush out and purchase everything you can find related to yoga all at once. Some items may be marketed as important to a yoga practice, when in reality they may not be helpful at all. For example, “yoga pants” don’t have to be only yoga pants. Allow your practice to develop and pay attention to what inspires you and how you feel in your body — then you’ll have a better idea of what you may need."
1345,Yoga,"How to check in with your body, follow up on progress, and measure success","ByAmanda B. Cunningham, aYoga Medicineinstructor based in Charleston, South Carolina. You can follow her journey atamandabyoga.com. The definition of progression is “the process of developing or moving gradually toward a more advanced state.” To measure progression within yoga practice, you must first define what “a more advanced state” means, and this is personal to each practitioner. So, what would success mean to you? Is it to tone up or de-stress? A balanced approach to checking in will include an overall look at your well-being. When 30-something athlete Alysia experienced a severe concussion, yoga played a huge role in her recovery. She notes that, “Yoga was the foundation that helped me be more mentally stable in a very emotionally up and down rehabilitation.” Alysia’s progression was documented over one and half years and focused on physical aspects such as balance, mindful transitions to avoid triggering headaches or dizziness, and strength building to counter muscle atrophy. Yoga allowed her to be more compassionate with herself as well as her recovery. To measure physical improvements, look for: Improved range of motion or ease of movement. A reduction in pain or discomfort and physical symptoms. An increase in physical strength and endurance. Less weight fluctuations. Changes in the ways your clothes fit. Better quality sleeping habits and increased or stable energy levels. No matter what your goals are, it’s important to remember that yoga is bringing together your body and mind. Dedicated practice will affect all aspects of your life, internally and externally, physically and mentally. And patience will play a role in this, too. It may take months or years to realize the deepest benefits of a personal practice. To measure mental improvements, look for: A drop in stress levels or mood swings. Growth in emotional awareness or equilibrium in emotional situations. Changes in personal, romantic, and professional relationships. An increased sense of self, or ability to live more presently. An increase in mental clarity and resilience. A deeper awareness of sensations in the body or reactions of the ego. The ability to control quality of breath. For 27-year-old Christy, yoga was a helping hand in kicking a pain killer addiction that left her insecure, emotional, overweight, and anxious. Through three months of journaling and private yoga practices, Christy found it easier to make choices that were good for her. She combined high-vigor Vinyasa classes and calming meditation practices, resulting in weight loss, self-confidence, and an overall sense of control. Here are some ways to measure progression: 1. Journal Write daily or weekly following the measurements above to chart your progress. Include events or situations that may have occurred. Document your experience, reaction, or emotions throughout. As time passes, it’ll be insightful to look back and review your past entries. 2. Group or 1:1 classes or therapy This can be group classes, 1:1 private yoga sessions, or therapy of any kind. When we involve professionals or nonbiased third parties, we allow for a second set of eyes to help us see our own progression. 3. Ask for feedback It can feel intimidating to ask loved ones or coworkers to comment on your progress, but it can also lead to many insights. Maybe someone’s noticed you’re less stressed and smile more often. Sometimes it’s easier for others to see us before we can truly see ourselves. 4. Set target dates Get your calendar out and set target dates. For example, set a goal to practice yoga once every day or to master the splits in 30 days. Include check-in dates to help you reach your goal. For some, seeing a visual on a calendar makes them feel more accountable. 5. Look at the scale or create before and after photos The physical body may change throughout your practice, so use the scale or images of yourself to track progression. Don’t focus on the numbers as much as the feeling. Notice if your muscles are stronger and your clothes are fitting better. This is a practice of overall well-being, so be kind to yourself and repeat this mantra:Practice makes progression!"
