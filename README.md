# Healthcare-Disease-Information-App

I built a project where I scraped healthcare data from Healthlineâ€™s disease directory to gather details like overviews, symptoms, and treatments. Using BeautifulSoup, I cleaned and structured the data, saving both raw HTML and a processed dataset for future use. I then created an interactive Streamlit app where users can select diseases and view key information in a clean, organized way. This project highlights how web scraping and Streamlit can transform scattered online content into an accessible tool.
